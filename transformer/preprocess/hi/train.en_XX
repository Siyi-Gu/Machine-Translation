tedster bill gates says i had an idea founding the first microcomputer software company

so you might be wondering whether we can also do this sort of thing across species and it turns out that if you take microbes from an obese person and transplant them into mice youve raised germfree those mice will also become fatter than if they received the microbes from a lean person but we can design a microbial community that we inoculate them with that prevents them from gaining this weight
