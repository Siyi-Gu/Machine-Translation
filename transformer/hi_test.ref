a couple of examples
its time we strike a new note
afraid
who was lurking
benefits and costs
it felt futile
thank you very much
what did we find
heres what happened
but what about now
heres an example
it is love first
so hit it again
this is so fabulous
blessings thank you
objectives key results
thank you very much
stop stop stop stop
there we go
redemption songs
thank you very much
thank you very much
how cool is that
are you awake
certain sorts of college
so there you have it
first and foremost
heres what it is
the objective is the direction
cheese chocolate where did that come from
now where do we go from there
and in fact thats whats happening
in fact she had aged a lot
but those surveillance features come at a cost
abuses
impossible
okay
why
josh

yeah right
but remember
its 1974
punches
not necessarily
try it
audience yeah
thank you
accountability
okay india
amazing
or does it
but not today
dont be afraid
where was i
art and nature
that is ridiculous
now hear this
this is math
thank you everybody
a new approach
im with him
its soil
we dont know
and in between
me neither
thats a lot
forgot this
its that simple
wk yeah
he knows everything
new york
im an artist
thats important
wk yeah
lb i do
is it just right
this is the winner
she looked at me
whats your sign
they have an impact
were you confused
and vanessa
thats my case
and who are these
stories are the key
how has this happened
what does this mean
so thats it
and you know what
because it was needed
it is lifeless
that is my idea
and it must be
that sounded familiar
and so we did
this has to go
happiness comes and goes
and guess what
have sex
have sex
but yes
no choice
true story
obese
run now
we know this
they all matter
he went on
its sexism
this is confidence
well not quite
i was broken
open it up
persist
you say it
theyre perfect
it was bad
they said culture
oh my god
there it is
wk yeah
clever guy
something against women
so i did
telegraph no
thank you folks
blue curtain
its very heavy
they were firm
the potential for change is there
not a lot of hands
this is a key issue
thats the indian story
both sides are right
thats what he heard
it was really bad news
she didnt show up
she is nine months old
i want to share a story
thats my aim here
thats your grandfather
thats my subjective way
i mean this is iraq
so whats the endgame
so keep doing it really hard
echo and attribute
well that would also be amazing
thats the troubling part
you see the importance of that
it was the moment of change
no meals on saturday
and others will lose their money
do you find that convincing
its not supposed to be that way
it used to not be like this
there was a caveat now though
but we were very sneaky
and so heres what i found
and she has this one passage here
thats where his strength lies
i mean how on earth did you do that
the journey was smooth
i am thinking now
not quite ten percent
what does that mean
thank you ted
we have the plan
get used to it
the day has come
thank you david
he didnt know
one person wins
so what happened here
thank you very much
thats rio
wk thank you
well a poor understanding
talk to trans people
these are my teachers
thats pretty cool
its a blast
thats right empty
we can do better
you can do this
and what about the web
you see the vibes
not so much the hair
how does that play out
but thats personal view
thats the second group
thats what you want
i was petrified
how did he do it
we know it all
i was afraid
we changed policy
thats true
im telling stories
are we evil
as well i should
thank you very much
be a green consumer
you cant catch me
are they beneficial
but it isnt
russia comes next
i have three solutions
its awful
that took five minutes
gone gone gone
its an ongoing process
and theyre different
boy how about this
thank you very much
but what is confidence
this is not new
so which is better
oh my god right
after the revolution three
but you know what
this is in berlin
how does it work
thank you for listening
its a tragedy
and you know what
share your story
its interesting
af yeah
maybe sometimes
fair enough
i do
stories matter
its secret
it really did
this was absurd
plants cant
that was fantastic
not working either
like a man
think about it
im gill
im playing around
its just ridiculous
its the opposite
stage iib
a solar storm
there are many
look somewhere else
were not talking
fast quick connect
wtf
close your eyes
here we are
thus i drafted up a schematic
now what i tell you next is the most important part
it will be within a decade not this decade
in reality it seems like a piece of silk
you want a scare
so thats paris
wk 12 watts
thats why were poor
so whats the answer
today it is a reality
thats a good opportunity
they need to to survive
where had that water gone
and we actually became friends
i was eight years old
enter harry beck
this is jomny
any other thumbs
and her mother behind her
and something else happened instead
we made it thinner
heres kallikuppam
how do i know that
so three things have happened
translate that for me
im a commodity person
and she was like me
that is a huge transformation
so how do we do that
yours is illogical
we dont tend to do that
joy is the gift of love
one is the question of education
and then there is padma
hed made a cosmesis
it means somebody who has arrived
so why is that
i think its ok
thank you very much
or something like that
i kept feeling it
the question is why
thank you thank you
what did you learn
hes my donor
what is a calendar
i did all that
guys this is real
thats the question
fw thank you
what words to use
so why is it
to create a tax
what about in practice
well done thank you
sam youre with me
so the people kept it
what is shiritori
we had some contentment
so i went to twitter
her name was chapungu
ham as in bad actor
what about the political system
well let me show you
so how is that possible
hes also our brother
and how do they live
show us the grades
but too late
csi climate
oh wow
you know
video yay
so practice
older
theyre all the product of that
but you get the idea i think
people wont have their backs
the victorians were great engineers
encouragement seems to be the key
it doesnt get depressed
so where do we go from there
i had become the enemy
ill give you one example of that
so this is a very common disease
because the brain has to do it
people have very different aptitudes
and sadly the list goes on
and then how did i deal with them
theres a book sitting in the background
a lot of children are orphans
well here are the worrying facts
but it has given birth to a new idea
same thing with every single password and so on
and you can stretch a scrunchie right
but actually the instrument itself isnt very entertaining
how would you walk or talk how would you be
i spoke to him on the phone at 1030 pm
and we are good at training our warriors to fight
the problem for me was not ignorance it was preconceived ideas
thank you thank you very much
i was all over the place
so what to do about it
ive never heard of them
so how does it do that
now weve got a mayor
we dont harp on that
it was the cause of it
we can analyze it
thats what emeka did
womens day was coming up
and thats the second question
may her soul rest in peace
the violin is very beautiful
why were there no restrictions
my family believes in me
both of those things are wrong
and a museum a science museum
can i get that for you
their cooperation is very rigid
so allow me to elaborate
to really meet up with them
they all have bank accounts
the game was an instant hit
its seen as hypocrisy
and my friends she was right
naaraaz means angry
the year is 1400 bce
it was a very beautiful time
and by 1980 the last train rode
but thats not always the case
how do you measure the best browser
we talk to people
first your close relationships
heres the problem
it felt toxic
these are from youtube
can you go there
you can exchange groups
and that is black
you read about it
are they cattle
but what about women
another place for people
what is a parent
the marathon grew
im actually pretty pleased
stay on the ground
you are brave
it looks like this
language cant math me
ao who is this
ive seen it
isnt it nice
why should we care
which is understandable
and we have one
it has millions of views
ca how much electricity
you just catch a laugh
mother went into a coma
sm but you know what
it was against the law
but i would say no
so that works better
i froze
get over yourself
no no way
what is this
no erica
people love cities
ca no indeed
that was 2003
sadly no
have sex again
twenty seconds left
okay so fine
thats called courage
thank you for listening
im a storyteller
thats odd
getting out of poverty
thats really amazing
and im your mirror
well i was too
everyone was scared
i want to conclude
this is serious stuff
what is that about
but things have changed
another place for people
imagine the following situation
so what about you
can you see it
is their experience changed
can we get there
its much nicer thank you
shes 16 years old
its not easy of course
it doesnt need it
the audience can talk back
its always about my taste
but again i was wrong
and this changes gradually
no loo no i do
otherwise it cant be done
what is wrong with me
words are a strange thing
he is ready to go
let me give you another example
other studies tell the same story
the other was indian cricket
they will not disappoint
we have inclassroom curriculum
p2 were in your corner
how did they punish me
what about the indus script
and hes here also today
so where did we go wrong
i hope you guys have three
she will ask the difficult questions
its the spirit of our culture
there have been many articles written
but its not just static
we can go to the beach
he screamed a lot
government officials are extremely mad
i dont want to feel these
bring me my sword
that was my private world
its also good with credit
friends and family were next
so thats good news
india t20 champions
people dont know we laugh
so i need a volunteer
this was a magic box
theres no other cause
and again theyre right
thats what he said
say aye go ahead
lc they did there
i dont believe in god
i was illiterate
and it can be done
how does that improve society
i couldnt disagree more
my ideas were unoriginal
men can do their part
i called in 26 children
and speak attentively
i cant take it anymore
and i wasnt alone
but i found my place
but yeah its all there
and heres what happened
i was finding my way
it will become many things
the counselor said so
thats what we do
so nature is made of chemicals
we are not interested in money
be a part of the system
and thats all we do
how far away was the finish line
and we should tread softly
so i concocted a plan
splashed across the headline
so language is a very powerful thing
and that was counterintuitive
but then i got a phone call
i got an errand to run
there are a bit harder issues
but this science is bigger than medicine
and then thats her over there
did you see her poke me
you feel deep deep guilt
but it wasnt always like that
so i wanted something to solve it
the oceans are starting to warm
how will it be a knowledge society
its pretty darn remarkable
this one is from myanmar
but then i found my calm place
that is a little bit too early
what we are interested in is information
and i came up with an idea
being trans is awkward
would our individual bills go down
all the others have been all those three
and then also there he had a choice
and there are two ways to do this
toxic and delicious
what passport do you hold
it shouldnt be that difficult
a bunch of pacifists
they were all in a line
thats a lot of people
but they were fighting it out
and he wasnt selective
thats a lot of gold
they aint got that power
this is what architecture does
its not just going to disappear
beth israels in boston
and there is a long pause
it will depend on inspired leadership
it matters a great deal
we are in 80 countries now
they brought new utensils
maybe a gunshot wound
and not in the obvious ways
some pay the price for it
lets play out a scenario
thats not bad is it
why 60 and not twelve
now silos are understandable
and you can also stand up
why would i buy insurance now
let me show you an example
you have to act it out
if you watch this its beautiful
and this is the mimic
she donned a turban
indra a hundred
until now
you ask why
he was 18
meet allison
now humans dont
papi help
nhh great
and she said no
it can break sometimes
and indeed they had
next its your turn
im working on it
and it was brilliant to be part of this team
what if that picture links to all of your pictures
he was very traumatized in so many different ways
and pakistan in this particular vein is very similar
blah blah blah blah blah
something that would stick to their ribs she said
so it’s less of an embodiment now
thank you for joining us hows your 2020 been
the school year in the united states is only 10 months
he pasted up portraits all over his reservation
its the most common term ive heard to describe that experience
and we think we can make refrigeration something that everybody can have
and go back to those three cases that i mentioned at the start
how many times do you think it could be folded like that
theres something else about these people these americans who are there
and server farms or data centers are great libraries of knowledge
ca well i would love to i mean this such an interesting and important idea
i apologize for the sexist conversation here but this is the way it really happened
heres why as long as the united states is out of the world system its not a closed system
this is not going to work out too well
people were dying in the streets
and this is my office on the sea
we called it the young scholars program
i was so excited i almost wet myself
so if we can get the lights
i took the note and looked at it
but what i found more of was love
but she was just that kind of person
i also like the intellectual macho games
we had our work cut out for us
and it turned out to be shame
we made all sorts of copies
but we really do need to think differently
now lets go back about a decade
we were in france in les houches
so just the afternoon one thursday
the social circle is whats key here
i actually smelt someone with some on earlier
to be compassionate is not a joke
what would reasonable adjustments look like for me
and there are some very good reasons for that
this is a more competent version of it
this is exactly what is happening with us today
and thats a real fantastic bulls eye
they cant see that stuff inside the tail
youre a little girl of five years old
turns out to be a little bit higher
and theres a book john gartner
so whats it like to be a baby
i mean how was i supposed to do it
id seen it happen over and over and over again
did we hit this target
well its a personal why
he turns four tomorrow
my story is not unique
a depression would do that
this is a coin game
we want to live well
fuzziness overlaps
for me its all three
man this program is wonderful
is it the expensive parking
and are you a hero
ca truly incredible congratulations
that makes 12 of them
we cant operate without it
but its not for everybody
so did our political problems
the blue there is india
not so fast im sorry
thats important to me
so let me explain that
children you cant catch me
lets seize it
th thank you chris
i was stigmatized
people climbed lamp posts
the answer is our imagination
that doesnt go there
so thank you very much
so this is very exciting
you cant medicate it
you guys just stay put
its called a prison
groundhog day
wow a volunteer yay
ok one last question
r number two relationships
dm yeah right
both men and women
its a great cover
ks good question
who killed your son
yet what is money
like this guy plato
and i said great
i feel confused
please shake their hands
hes very kind
or i heart you
i needed an education
my brother heard that
and similar topography
i need more light
what else are we missing
that kind of food yeah
you know what they say
respect goes a long way
that was discouraging
thats around the corner
to the virus were not
i said hey john
yet we throw it away
so back to economics
this is my failure story
this is khadija hamsa
now i throw out the data
we received 372 responses
im so proud of my life
of course thats not possible
and here its so far away
and we have to do that
they made beautiful handmade products
or do you keep her warm
you were responsible for your decision
have they not been played with
its called the social stress test
ill give you a couple seconds
some of its transportation access
the third step was a challenge
why should we care about this
dr gautam bhan everyone
now we dont think that way
so those are the three as
and i give lots of evidence
then i looked at the funding
its a bigger issue for me
and you know these dogs
if you didnt you failed
i wanted to abandon my post
thats a very new situation
for me this became incredibly important
lets call him mike
i will not kill for you
obviously its difficult to calculate
meditate for half an hour
but this is a proxy
they want to change the world
the world is fucked up
why is it future air
meaning though is deeper
were at a critical moment
i will come to it later
and how can we do it
do we know better than them
these differences were highly significant
on this stage in this room
well im here to tell you
thats where children experience life
math differential equations
like the things that people use
the no sign was pretty clear
this makes an igloo
rhodes must fall
the idea matters a lot
that i never learned to do
each photo tells a story
what are we going to do
ive been doing some thinking
the question is what happens next
i didnt give up then
and they didnt say anything
he heard a very different story
so where are you a local
we should retain those people
this is not uncommon
people worry a lot about this
this is an extremely strange fact
he was born there in 1924
and essentially we have three mandates
lets look at the development side
a billion more people in that time
and i just ate it up
let me just put that into context
and i naturalized as a citizen
thats roughly how it happened
thats why they call them that
here i got a prison assignment
it was a childs lab kit
and everyones somewhere in the middle
what has been my experience with it
they were using it on their body
we shut it down one time
the nucleus is crazy small
and you might save a ton of money
its what they do at that age
they help me plan out the whole piece
i have no other choice in the matter
were also not the goal of evolution
20 million homes thats 100 million people
you can think of it as a password
so on my birthday what did i do
so where should we be putting the money
again all the rock climbers japanese ones
now what does the year 2100 look like
and theres some spectacular things
and it gives me a lot of hope
thats the voice of my anxiety talking
but did the regime learn anything not really
its an awful lot of fun
she won with 75 percent of the vote
so nobody is tonedeaf
seven and a half billion of us
to hear their ideas and their solutions
lets look at a basic comparison
hes not part of my family
it may even know some extra information
now we didnt write this app
pick a percentage in your own mind
were in the fourth industrial revolution
boy whats making this light up
six major research papers on this
its in that context that i work
this is the path were currently on
what is contained in this information
this is last year in china
and language is actually a problem here
so the other type of access financial
but does it just happen over there
this is our mosquito city
im playing around with metaphors
its the way they were programmed
in this case we tested it
i assure you i did feel fear
but of course its not that simple
tony came to live with me
and we just did a little intervention
but we do not know his face
my mother has never been to school
education is one side of a coin
its getting more oxygen to your brain
whats the way forward from here
we can look at the waves
more like hiding
love them
everyone does
violent she says
please help me
look at gender
pm excuse me
god please help us
i know that beat
we need three things
and they said yeah
cost to country zero
you may kiss
then it got dark
because we triage
heres what ive learned from my own experience
that pounding heart is preparing you for action
so heres some of the characters that we have
there is no one who has done it so far
theres a second piece of this thats important
the challenge we face this time however is one of time
and so thats why the death rate did come down
but the hymen doesnt have to break at all
the whole family has different things to commend to it
it might have shown up as early as 2000 bce
and today this video that i made is my most popular video
send 1500 pounds via a giant gummy lizard
home is not a car or some sort of jewellery
and what i need now is to learn to be like that
and what i want to do is not show a realistic scene
this is where our mosquitocatching work gets really interesting
before you move on i encourage you to actually think about a possible answer to this question
the russians want to do more leadership
thats why we call it the internet
in a lot of ways hes right
and you will have to educate them
death is such a taboo subject right
and it really depends on the story
how much social progress does that get us
well we rejected all of that
theres an evolutionary reason for this
but it may look a bit different from before
this is what biomedical engineers do
despite all that i tried to understand him
but i have decided it’s a cat
well what we see is a lot of progress
and youve got trillions of them
how many of you have ever had that experience
we thought of people as a liability
and theyre not going down the right path
so can we pull off the same trick again
and that is not an easy thing to find
and in the visual arts the same thing happened
so we can eliminate all the profiles
now heres the even more striking thing
i for one was steeped in these
look at her posture its remarkable
these hearings lasted for almost two months
but then something miraculous started to happen
man shes been there since three oclock
so i decided i wanted to do something more
the consumers want a role to play in this
remember your first interview what am i going to wear
or is it the fear of the unknown
of course we can do this
boom this is what happened
have you seen these guys
hi everyone im sirena
actually we enjoy working there
but well never win the race
their throats were slit
and thats quite a thought
this is my heritage
i think this is a problem
does the water stay there forever
so altruism does exist
you stood for the right cause
so globalization is continuing
so the idea was pretty simple
its a universal childs toy
and so it goes on
so eric come on over
i said what do you see
i could get access to it
and theres dan etete
its about letting it happen
that chord doesnt work
they have not been trained
our experience is where were from
b they got into my head
your legs start wearing out
dm did you not care
this is no hypothetical question
nobody knows where they are
and no one raised their hand
ca that is a big vision
its made by a bacteria
so it actually works
is it one car two
ca last question larry
its actually morphed
assam kanak gogoi
and here we are now
its sad to be old
just be who you are
and they both laughed
who are your foreignborn
can we cure climate change
hh oh of course
two can you defend it
that is emotional correctness
we say whats important
it sounds scary
so i was very happy
im going to kill dad
is it the intense smell
completely changed 180 degrees
can they kill us all
but most people dont agree
started walking towards the public
national message targeted individuals
lets make more lines
okay thank you very much
he would almost always win
her fashion was colorful
there could be other solutions
and then our relationship stopped
were in a dangerous cycle
those are prochlorococcus
you have now completed the test
and theres no wires
young people themselves have named it
and thats my brain in love
put yourselves in my position
but we dont often think about them
how could they do this to me
id like to introduce you to someone
and its not true of enough people
so i decided to drop my name
it was easier it was cheaper
and this is in amsterdam
now my friends were not bad parents
but that isnt true for everyone
so they felt safe to come there
and hell show where it is
how many birds am i hearing
they use mobutu as metaphor
the list goes on and goes wide
this has always been an important question
or is this research forever or what
lc we can handle the rest
i want to be with my mother
that role was to suffer in secret
its a difficult place to work in
this town was established 800 years ago
you put a little sticky tape
theres no rocket science here
the sense of pride pride is essential
i wrote this piece a year ago
i kept my emotions on hold
and then it becomes more
so i decided to go there
its in my pocket right now
i started this with community support
we exist and we are free
we need a new economics
behind each image is a story
and that lady reminded me
same process just a different trigger
now it goes down to a
the cavalrys not coming
fellas we are the problem
why three a couple of reasons
thats usually not the route
and our kids are succeeding
we can open up city hall
i said is that thing real
mm it starts playing immediately
so they hold us to it
i wont comment on that
i felt the weight of stigma
the results have not been consistent
we can discuss what we love
i propose a threestep test
this is the pudong area
she is after all cuban
the other 75 percent is lifestyle
its a conversation about augmentation
dont start wrestling yet
i think it was good advice
but we still have many questions
this is not a sustainable model
its not because i wasnt born there
unfortunately thats not the case
its the first time wed done this
now i want you to relax your hand
she will not ask of your mentions
thank you so much for having us here
motor racing is a funny old business
they wanted us to be analytical
it was climbing it was ruins
from 83 to 95 two percent per annum
this caused major riots in my city
first question to answer for us so what
well its me on my sailing boat
execution is what matters the most
they dont focus on the courts alone
she liked to do things for you
it has to stand out from the crowd
we have such a long way to go
how about a moderate amount of stress
the dude wasnt a stranger
theyd say this is very boring
what is the problem in your own words
well some of that sprang from our work
it is the end of the poker face
and so we have to think about this
it should be a challenge of creating wealth
having graduated what happened next thank you
this is the world without plankton
and i had to get out of town
the consequences in those cases could be dire
but theres another revolutionary element here
so to conclude part one were completely screwed
you want a better life for yourself
for me theyre all amazing people
but most importantly its voluntary
that was prochlorococcus
no it was not an easy task
so you know how i came out
im sure i had the same look

the emergency generators did not start
the difference between where are you from

i grew up with this woman
but lets approach it with love
and now perhaps perhaps you do too
theyre aggressive but realistic
observe the upperleft one
so whens the article coming out
the hot winds cannot touch you
and i knocked on the door

so the empire can strike back
we need help we need help

why is this person telling me this story
sold i to the merchant ships
now to the second potential misunderstanding
id like to end on a personal note
her mother worked for me for 42 years
but this is the opportunity that i see
i ended up on a conservative website
its not that people dont want to act
so what are people actually motivated by
these things dont exist outside of the office
and we each have the capacity to love
and they have dedicated their lives to it
a protected value isnt just any value
thats why we are where we are
give me a plot of that versus time
what i witnessed was unimaginable
how were you able to make it out
and i felt lighter in my body
lets assume you were born somewhere else
and youve seen children develop physically
for a more grandiose effect i guess
now its just the green and the blue
you also have to work really really hard
loving only others is ineffective
the next day the land looked like this
she meant organizing somebodys closet
but something amazing is about to happen here

two months later something incredible occurs
i mean this is within our childrens lifetime
another half an hour and we would have won
so one has got to discover a certain wholeness
we are going to have to start all over again
but we came across a new phenomenon
but theres a story behind this data as well
usually theres not water present at the base there
but what is most amazing is the effect on girls
but are we really all just like rascals
even the most powerful microscopes cant see this
when were in a moment of overwhelm
i had a port installed in my chest
there are also financial reforms in rural china
this is happening over an unbelievable scale
but you see they dont really hold a grudge
in fact you get more bang for your buck
its what i hope for all of our children
so lets look at some of the neuroscience
and nature builds large skeletons out of it
but at that moment work wasnt my priority
and it was exactly appropriate for a threeyearold
the proof may just be in the pandas

first you want to pick a problem or a topic to brainstorm
to be clear im not suggesting that we do away with countries
in fact all of us are multi multilocal multilayered
so step one lets say youve got a group of friends
and how far can you take that how far can you take it
and bear in mind im talking of most of the worlds land now
currently we land on a separate pad or we land out on a boat
it includes topics like savings and investing budgeting and debt
