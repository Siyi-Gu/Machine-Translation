Thank you so much, Chris. 
And it's truly a great honor to have the opportunity to come to this stage twice; I'm extremely grateful. 
I have been blown away by this conference, and I want to thank all of you for the many nice comments about what I had to say the other night. 
And I say that sincerely, partly because (Mock sob) I need that. 
(Laughter) Put yourselves in my position. 
(Laughter) I flew on Air Force Two for eight years. 
(Laughter) Now I have to take off my shoes or boots to get on an airplane! 
(Laughter) (Applause) I'll tell you one quick story to illustrate what that's been like for me. 
(Laughter) It's a true story -- every bit of this is true. 
Soon after Tipper and I left the -- (Mock sob) White House -- (Laughter) we were driving from our home in Nashville to a little farm we have 50 miles east of Nashville. 
Driving ourselves. 
(Laughter) I know it sounds like a little thing to you, but -- (Laughter) I looked in the rear-view mirror and all of a sudden it just hit me. 
There was no motorcade back there. 
(Laughter) You've heard of phantom limb pain? 
(Laughter) This was a rented Ford Taurus. 
(Laughter) It was dinnertime, and we started looking for a place to eat. 
We were on I-40. 
We got off the exit, we found a Shoney's restaurant. 
Low-cost family restaurant chain, for those of you who don't know it. 
We went in and sat down at the booth, and the waitress came over, made a big commotion over Tipper. 
(Laughter) She took our order, and then went to the couple in the booth next to us, and she lowered her voice so much, I had to really strain to hear what she was saying. 
And she said "Yes, that's former Vice President Al Gore and his wife, Tipper." 
And the man said, "He's come down a long way, hasn't he?" 
(Laughter) (Applause) There's been kind of a series of epiphanies. 
(Laughter) The very next day, continuing the totally true story, I got on a G-V to fly to Africa to make a speech in Nigeria, in the city of Lagos, on the topic of energy. 
And I began the speech by telling them the story of what had just happened the day before in Nashville. 
And I told it pretty much the same way I've just shared it with you: Tipper and I were driving ourselves, Shoney's, low-cost family restaurant chain, what the man said -- they laughed. 
I gave my speech, then went back out to the airport to fly back home. 
I fell asleep on the plane until, during the middle of the night, we landed on the Azores Islands for refueling. 
I woke up, they opened the door, I went out to get some fresh air, and I looked, and there was a man running across the runway. 
And he was waving a piece of paper, and he was yelling, "Call Washington! Call Washington!" 
And I thought to myself, in the middle of the night, in the middle of the Atlantic, what in the world could be wrong in Washington? 
Then I remembered it could be a bunch of things. 
(Laughter) But what it turned out to be, was that my staff was extremely upset because one of the wire services in Nigeria had already written a story about my speech, and it had already been printed in cities all across the United States of America. 
It was printed in Monterey, I checked. 
(Laughter) And the story began, "Former Vice President Al Gore announced in Nigeria yesterday," quote: 'My wife Tipper and I have opened a low-cost family restaurant'" -- (Laughter) "'named Shoney's, and we are running it ourselves.'" (Laughter) Before I could get back to U.S. soil, David Letterman and Jay Leno had already started in on -- one of them had me in a big white chef's hat, Tipper was saying, "One more burger with fries!" 
(Laughter) Three days later, I got a nice, long, handwritten letter from my friend and partner and colleague Bill Clinton, saying, "Congratulations on the new restaurant, Al!" 
(Laughter) We like to celebrate each other's successes in life. 
(Laughter) I was going to talk about information ecology. 
But I was thinking that, since I plan to make a lifelong habit of coming back to TED, that maybe I could talk about that another time. 
(Applause) Chris Anderson: It's a deal! 
(Applause) Al Gore: I want to focus on what many of you have said you would like me to elaborate on: What can you do about the climate crisis? 
I want to start with a couple of -- I'm going to show some new images, and I'm going to recapitulate just four or five. 
Now, the slide show. 
I add new images, because I learn more about it every time I give it. 
It's like beach-combing, you know? 
Every time the tide comes in and out, you find some more shells. 
Just in the last two days, we got the new temperature records in January. 
This is just for the United States of America. 
Historical average for Januarys is 31 degrees; last month was 39.5 degrees. 
Now, I know that you wanted some more bad news about the environment -- I'm kidding. 
But these are the recapitulation slides, and then I'm going to go into new material about what you can do. 
But I wanted to elaborate on a couple of these. 
First of all, this is where we're projected to go with the U.S. contribution to global warming, under business as usual. 
Efficiency in end-use electricity and end-use of all energy is the low-hanging fruit. 
Efficiency and conservation -- it's not a cost; it's a profit. 
The sign is wrong. 
It's not negative; it's positive. 
These are investments that pay for themselves. 
But they are also very effective in deflecting our path. 
Cars and trucks -- I talked about that in the slideshow, but I want you to put it in perspective. 
It's an easy, visible target of concern -- and it should be -- but there is more global warming pollution that comes from buildings than from cars and trucks. 
Cars and trucks are very significant, and we have the lowest standards in the world. 
And so we should address that. But it's part of the puzzle. 
Other transportation efficiency is as important as cars and trucks. 
Renewables at the current levels of technological efficiency can make this much difference. 
And with what Vinod, and John Doerr and others, many of you here -- there are a lot of people directly involved in this -- this wedge is going to grow much more rapidly than the current projection shows it. 
Carbon Capture and Sequestration -- that's what CCS stands for -- is likely to become the killer app that will enable us to continue to use fossil fuels in a way that is safe. 
Not quite there yet. 
OK. Now, what can you do? 
Most of these expenditures are also profitable. 
Insulation, better design. 
I mentioned automobiles -- buy a hybrid. 
Use light rail. 
Figure out some of the other options that are much better. 
It's important. 
Be a green consumer. 
You have choices with everything you buy, between things that have a harsh effect, or a much less harsh effect on the global climate crisis. 
Consider this: Make a decision to live a carbon-neutral life. 
Those of you who are good at branding, I'd love to get your advice and help on how to say this in a way that connects with the most people. 
It is easier than you think. 
A lot of us in here have made that decision, and it is really pretty easy. 
It means reduce your carbon dioxide emissions with the full range of choices that you make, and then purchase or acquire offsets for the remainder that you have not completely reduced. 
There is a carbon calculator. 
Participant Productions convened -- with my active involvement -- the leading software writers in the world, on this arcane science of carbon calculation, to construct a consumer-friendly carbon calculator. 
You can very precisely calculate what your CO2 emissions are, and then you will be given options to reduce. 
And by the time the movie comes out in May, this will be updated to 2.0, and we will have click-through purchases of offsets. 
Next, consider making your business carbon-neutral. 
Again, some of us have done that, and it's not as hard as you think. 
Integrate climate solutions into all of your innovations, whether you are from the technology, or entertainment, or design and architecture community. 
Invest sustainably. 
Majora mentioned this. 
Listen, if you have invested money with managers who you compensate on the basis of their annual performance, don't ever again complain about quarterly report CEO management. 
Over time, people do what you pay them to do. 
And if they judge how much they're going to get paid on your capital that they've invested, based on the short-term returns, you're going to get short-term decisions. 
A lot more to be said about that. 
Become a catalyst of change. 
Teach others, learn about it, talk about it. 
The movie is a movie version of the slideshow I gave two nights ago, except it's a lot more entertaining. 
And it comes out in May. 
Many of you here have the opportunity to ensure that a lot of people see it. 
Consider sending somebody to Nashville. 
Pick well. 
And I am personally going to train people to give this slideshow -- re-purposed, with some of the personal stories obviously replaced with a generic approach, and it's not just the slides, it's what they mean. 
And it's how they link together. 
And so I'm going to be conducting a course this summer for a group of people that are nominated by different folks to come and then give it en masse, in communities all across the country, and we're going to update the slideshow for all of them every single week, to keep it right on the cutting edge. 
Working with Larry Lessig, it will be, somewhere in that process, posted with tools and limited-use copyrights, so that young people can remix it and do it in their own way. 
(Applause) Where did anybody get the idea that you ought to stay arm's length from politics? 
We need Republicans as well. 
This used to be a bipartisan issue, and I know that in this group it really is. 
Become politically active. 
Make our democracy work the way it's supposed to work. 
Support the idea of capping carbon dioxide emissions -- global warming pollution -- and trading it. 
Here's why: as long as the United States is out of the world system, it's not a closed system. 
Once it becomes a closed system, with U.S. participation, then everybody who's on a board of directors -- how many people here serve on the board of directors of a corporation? 
Once it's a closed system, you will have legal liability if you do not urge your CEO to get the maximum income from reducing and trading the carbon emissions that can be avoided. 
Help with the mass persuasion campaign that will start this spring. 
We have to change the minds of the American people. 
Because presently, the politicians do not have permission to do what needs to be done. 
And in our modern country, the role of logic and reason no longer includes mediating between wealth and power the way it once did. 
It's now repetition of short, hot-button, 30-second, 28-second television ads. 
We have to buy a lot of those ads. 
Let's re-brand global warming, as many of you have suggested. 
I like "climate crisis" instead of "climate collapse," but again, those of you who are good at branding, I need your help on this. 
Somebody said the test we're facing now, a scientist told me, is whether the combination of an opposable thumb and a neocortex is a viable combination. 
(Laughter) That's really true. 
Again, the Republicans here -- this shouldn't be partisan. 
You have more influence than some of us who are Democrats do. 
This is an opportunity. 
Not just this, but connected to the ideas that are here, to bring more coherence to them. 
We are one. 
Thank you very much, I appreciate it. 
(Applause) 

Now I'm going to give you a story. 
It's an Indian story about an Indian woman and her journey. 
Let me begin with my parents. 
I'm a product of this visionary mother and father. 
Many years ago, when I was born in the '50s -- '50s and '60s didn't belong to girls in India. 
They belonged to boys. 
They belonged to boys who would join business and inherit business from parents, and girls would be dolled up to get married. 
My family, in my city, and almost in the country, was unique. 
We were four of us, not one, and fortunately no boys. 
We were four girls and no boys. 
And my parents were part of a landed property family. 
My father defied his own grandfather, almost to the point of disinheritance, because he decided to educate all four of us. 
He sent us to one of the best schools in the city and gave us the best education. 
As I've said, when we're born, we don't choose our parents, and when we go to school, we don't choose our school. 
Children don't choose a school. 
They just get the school which parents choose for them. 
So this is the foundation time which I got. 
I grew up like this, and so did my other three sisters. 
And my father used to say at that time, "I'm going to spread all my four daughters in four corners of the world." 
I don't know if he really meant [that], but it happened. 
I'm the only one who's left in India. 
One is a British, another is an American and the third is a Canadian. 
So we are four of us in four corners of the world. 
And since I said they're my role models, I followed two things which my father and mother gave me. 
One, they said, "Life is on an incline. 
You either go up, or you come down." 
And the second thing, which has stayed with me, which became my philosophy of life, which made all the difference, is: 100 things happen in your life, good or bad. 
Out of 100, 90 are your creation. 
They're good. They're your creation. Enjoy it. 
If they're bad, they're your creation. Learn from it. 
Ten are nature-sent over which you can't do a thing. 
It's like a death of a relative, or a cyclone, or a hurricane, or an earthquake. 
You can't do a thing about it. 
You've got to just respond to the situation. 
But that response comes out of those 90 points. 
Since I'm a product of this philosophy, of 90/10, and secondly, "life on an incline," that's the way I grew up to be valuing what I got. 
I'm a product of opportunities, rare opportunities in the '50s and the '60s, which girls didn't get, and I was conscious of the fact that what my parents were giving me was something unique. 
Because all of my best school friends were getting dolled up to get married with a lot of dowry, and here I was with a tennis racket and going to school and doing all kinds of extracurricular activities. 
I thought I must tell you this. 
Why I said this, is the background. 
This is what comes next. 
I joined the Indian Police Service as a tough woman, a woman with indefatigable stamina, because I used to run for my tennis titles, etc. 
But I joined the Indian Police Service, and then it was a new pattern of policing. 
For me the policing stood for power to correct, power to prevent and power to detect. 
This is something like a new definition ever given in policing in India -- the power to prevent. 
Because normally it was always said, power to detect, and that's it, or power to punish. 
But I decided no, it's a power to prevent, because that's what I learned when I was growing up. 
How do I prevent the 10 and never make it more than 10? 
So this was how it came into my service, and it was different from the men. 
I didn't want to make it different from the men, but it was different, because this was the way I was different. 
And I redefined policing concepts in India. 
I'm going to take you on two journeys, my policing journey and my prison journey. 
What you see, if you see the title called "PM's car held." 
This was the first time a prime minister of India was given a parking ticket. 
(Laughter) That's the first time in India, and I can tell you, that's the last time you're hearing about it. 
It'll never happen again in India, because now it was once and forever. 
And the rule was, because I was sensitive, I was compassionate, I was very sensitive to injustice, and I was very pro-justice. 
That's the reason, as a woman, I joined the Indian Police Service. 
I had other options, but I didn't choose them. 
So I'm going to move on. 
This is about tough policing, equal policing. 
Now I was known as "here's a woman that's not going to listen." 
So I was sent to all indiscriminate postings, postings which others would say no. 
I now went to a prison assignment as a police officer. 
Normally police officers don't want to do prison. 
They sent me to prison to lock me up, thinking, "Now there will be no cars and no VIPs to be given tickets to. 
Let's lock her up." 
Here I got a prison assignment. 
This was a prison assignment which was one big den of criminals. 
Obviously, it was. 
But 10,000 men, of which only 400 were women -- 10,000 -- 9,000 plus about 600 were men. 
Terrorists, rapists, burglars, gangsters -- some of them I'd sent to jail as a police officer outside. 
And then how did I deal with them? 
The first day when I went in, I didn't know how to look at them. 
And I said, "Do you pray?" When I looked at the group, I said, "Do you pray?" 
They saw me as a young, short woman wearing a pathan suit. 
I said, "Do you pray?" 
And they didn't say anything. 
I said, "Do you pray? Do you want to pray?" 
They said, "Yes." I said, "All right, let's pray." 
I prayed for them, and things started to change. 
This is a visual of education inside the prison. 
Friends, this has never happened, where everybody in the prison studies. 
I started this with community support. 
Government had no budget. 
It was one of the finest, largest volunteerism in any prison in the world. 
This was initiated in Delhi prison. 
You see one sample of a prisoner teaching a class. 
These are hundreds of classes. 
Nine to eleven, every prisoner went into the education program -- the same den in which they thought they would put me behind the bar and things would be forgotten. 
We converted this into an ashram -- from a prison to an ashram through education. 
I think that's the bigger change. 
It was the beginning of a change. 
Teachers were prisoners. Teachers were volunteers. 
Books came from donated schoolbooks. 
Stationery was donated. 
Everything was donated, because there was no budget of education for the prison. 
Now if I'd not done that, it would have been a hellhole. 
That's the second landmark. 
I want to show you some moments of history in my journey, which probably you would never ever get to see anywhere in the world. 
One, the numbers you'll never get to see. 
Secondly, this concept. 
This was a meditation program inside the prison of over 1,000 prisoners. 
One thousand prisoners who sat in meditation. 
This was one of the most courageous steps I took as a prison governor. 
And this is what transformed. 
You want to know more about this, go and see this film, "Doing Time, Doing Vipassana." 
You will hear about it, and you will love it. 
And write to me on KiranBedi.com, and I'll respond to you. 
Let me show you the next slide. 
I took the same concept of mindfulness, because, why did I bring meditation into the Indian prison? 
Because crime is a product of a distorted mind. 
It was distortion of mind which needed to be addressed to control. 
Not by preaching, not by telling, not by reading, but by addressing your mind. 
I took the same thing to the police, because police, equally, were prisoners of their minds, and they felt as if it was "we" and "they," and that the people don't cooperate. 
This worked. 
This is a feedback box called a petition box. 
This is a concept which I introduced to listen to complaints, listen to grievances. 
This was a magic box. 
This was a sensitive box. 
This is how a prisoner drew how they felt about the prison. 
If you see somebody in the blue -- yeah, this guy -- he was a prisoner, and he was a teacher. 
And you see, everybody's busy. There was no time to waste. 
Let me wrap it up. 
I'm currently into movements, movements of education of the under-served children, which is thousands -- India is all about thousands. 
Secondly is about the anti-corruption movement in India. 
That's a big way we, as a small group of activists, have drafted an ombudsman bill for the government of India. 
Friends, you will hear a lot about it. 
That's the movement at the moment I'm driving, and that's the movement and ambition of my life. 
Thank you very much. 
(Applause) Thank you. Thank you very much. Thank you. 
Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. 

I work on helping computers communicate about the world around us. 
There are a lot of ways to do this, and I like to focus on helping computers to talk about what they see and understand. 
Given a scene like this, a modern computer-vision algorithm can tell you that there's a woman and there's a dog. 
It can tell you that the woman is smiling. 
It might even be able to tell you that the dog is incredibly cute. 
I work on this problem thinking about how humans understand and process the world. 
The thoughts, memories and stories that a scene like this might evoke for humans. 
All the interconnections of related situations. 
Maybe you've seen a dog like this one before, or you've spent time running on a beach like this one, and that further evokes thoughts and memories of a past vacation, past times to the beach, times spent running around with other dogs. 
One of my guiding principles is that by helping computers to understand what it's like to have these experiences, to understand what we share and believe and feel, then we're in a great position to start evolving computer technology in a way that's complementary with our own experiences. 
So, digging more deeply into this, a few years ago I began working on helping computers to generate human-like stories from sequences of images. 
So, one day, I was working with my computer to ask it what it thought about a trip to Australia. 
It took a look at the pictures, and it saw a koala. 
It didn't know what the koala was, but it said it thought it was an interesting-looking creature. 
Then I shared with it a sequence of images about a house burning down. 
It took a look at the images and it said, "This is an amazing view! This is spectacular!" 
It sent chills down my spine. 
It saw a horrible, life-changing and life-destroying event and thought it was something positive. 
I realized that it recognized the contrast, the reds, the yellows, and thought it was something worth remarking on positively. 
And part of why it was doing this was because most of the images I had given it were positive images. 
That's because people tend to share positive images when they talk about their experiences. 
When was the last time you saw a selfie at a funeral? 
I realized that, as I worked on improving AI task by task, dataset by dataset, that I was creating massive gaps, holes and blind spots in what it could understand. 
And while doing so, I was encoding all kinds of biases. 
Biases that reflect a limited viewpoint, limited to a single dataset -- biases that can reflect human biases found in the data, such as prejudice and stereotyping. 
I thought back to the evolution of the technology that brought me to where I was that day -- how the first color images were calibrated against a white woman's skin, meaning that color photography was biased against black faces. 
And that same bias, that same blind spot continued well into the '90s. 
And the same blind spot continues even today in how well we can recognize different people's faces in facial recognition technology. 
I though about the state of the art in research today, where we tend to limit our thinking to one dataset and one problem. 
And that in doing so, we were creating more blind spots and biases that the AI could further amplify. 
I realized then that we had to think deeply about how the technology we work on today looks in five years, in 10 years. 
Humans evolve slowly, with time to correct for issues in the interaction of humans and their environment. 
In contrast, artificial intelligence is evolving at an incredibly fast rate. 
And that means that it really matters that we think about this carefully right now -- that we reflect on our own blind spots, our own biases, and think about how that's informing the technology we're creating and discuss what the technology of today will mean for tomorrow. 
CEOs and scientists have weighed in on what they think the artificial intelligence technology of the future will be. 
Stephen Hawking warns that "Artificial intelligence could end mankind." 
Elon Musk warns that it's an existential risk and one of the greatest risks that we face as a civilization. 
Bill Gates has made the point, "I don't understand why people aren't more concerned." 
But these views -- they're part of the story. 
The math, the models, the basic building blocks of artificial intelligence are something that we call access and all work with. 
We have open-source tools for machine learning and intelligence that we can contribute to. 
And beyond that, we can share our experience. 
We can share our experiences with technology and how it concerns us and how it excites us. 
We can discuss what we love. 
We can communicate with foresight about the aspects of technology that could be more beneficial or could be more problematic over time. 
If we all focus on opening up the discussion on AI with foresight towards the future, this will help create a general conversation and awareness about what AI is now, what it can become and all the things that we need to do in order to enable that outcome that best suits us. 
We already see and know this in the technology that we use today. 
We use smart phones and digital assistants and Roombas. 
Are they evil? 
Maybe sometimes. 
Are they beneficial? 
Yes, they're that, too. 
And they're not all the same. 
And there you already see a light shining on what the future holds. 
The future continues on from what we build and create right now. 
We set into motion that domino effect that carves out AI's evolutionary path. 
In our time right now, we shape the AI of tomorrow. 
Technology that immerses us in augmented realities bringing to life past worlds. 
Technology that helps people to share their experiences when they have difficulty communicating. 
Technology built on understanding the streaming visual worlds used as technology for self-driving cars. 
Technology built on understanding images and generating language, evolving into technology that helps people who are visually impaired be better able to access the visual world. 
And we also see how technology can lead to problems. 
We have technology today that analyzes physical characteristics we're born with -- such as the color of our skin or the look of our face -- in order to determine whether or not we might be criminals or terrorists. 
We have technology that crunches through our data, even data relating to our gender or our race, in order to determine whether or not we might get a loan. 
All that we see now is a snapshot in the evolution of artificial intelligence. 
Because where we are right now, is within a moment of that evolution. 
That means that what we do now will affect what happens down the line and in the future. 
If we want AI to evolve in a way that helps humans, then we need to define the goals and strategies that enable that path now. 
What I'd like to see is something that fits well with humans, with our culture and with the environment. 
Technology that aids and assists those of us with neurological conditions or other disabilities in order to make life equally challenging for everyone. 
Technology that works regardless of your demographics or the color of your skin. 
And so today, what I focus on is the technology for tomorrow and for 10 years from now. 
AI can turn out in many different ways. 
But in this case, it isn't a self-driving car without any destination. 
This is the car that we are driving. 
We choose when to speed up and when to slow down. 
We choose if we need to make a turn. 
We choose what the AI of the future will be. 
There's a vast playing field of all the things that artificial intelligence can become. 
It will become many things. 
And it's up to us now, in order to figure out what we need to put in place to make sure the outcomes of artificial intelligence are the ones that will be better for all of us. 
Thank you. 
(Applause) 

So for any of us in this room today, let's start out by admitting we're lucky. 
We don't live in the world our mothers lived in, our grandmothers lived in, where career choices for women were so limited. 
And if you're in this room today, most of us grew up in a world where we have basic civil rights, and amazingly, we still live in a world where some women don't have them. 
But all that aside, we still have a problem, and it's a real problem. 
And the problem is this: Women are not making it to the top of any profession anywhere in the world. 
The numbers tell the story quite clearly. 
190 heads of state -- nine are women. 
Of all the people in parliament in the world, 13 percent are women. 
In the corporate sector, women at the top, C-level jobs, board seats -- tops out at 15, 16 percent. 
The numbers have not moved since 2002 and are going in the wrong direction. 
And even in the non-profit world, a world we sometimes think of as being led by more women, women at the top: 20 percent. 
We also have another problem, which is that women face harder choices between professional success and personal fulfillment. 
A recent study in the U.S. showed that, of married senior managers, two-thirds of the married men had children and only one-third of the married women had children. 
A couple of years ago, I was in New York, and I was pitching a deal, and I was in one of those fancy New York private equity offices you can picture. 
And I'm in the meeting -- it's about a three-hour meeting -- and two hours in, there needs to be that bio break, and everyone stands up, and the partner running the meeting starts looking really embarrassed. 
And I realized he doesn't know where the women's room is in his office. 
So I start looking around for moving boxes, figuring they just moved in, but I don't see any. 
And so I said, "Did you just move into this office?" 
And he said, "No, we've been here about a year." 
And I said, "Are you telling me that I am the only woman to have pitched a deal in this office in a year?" 
And he looked at me, and he said, "Yeah. Or maybe you're the only one who had to go to the bathroom." 
(Laughter) So the question is, how are we going to fix this? 
How do we change these numbers at the top? 
How do we make this different? 
I want to start out by saying, I talk about this -- about keeping women in the workforce -- because I really think that's the answer. 
In the high-income part of our workforce, in the people who end up at the top -- Fortune 500 CEO jobs, or the equivalent in other industries -- the problem, I am convinced, is that women are dropping out. 
Now people talk about this a lot, and they talk about things like flextime and mentoring and programs companies should have to train women. 
I want to talk about none of that today, even though that's all really important. 
Today I want to focus on what we can do as individuals. 
What are the messages we need to tell ourselves? 
What are the messages we tell the women that work with and for us? 
What are the messages we tell our daughters? 
Now, at the outset, I want to be very clear that this speech comes with no judgments. 
I don't have the right answer. 
I don't even have it for myself. 
I left San Francisco, where I live, on Monday, and I was getting on the plane for this conference. 
And my daughter, who's three, when I dropped her off at preschool, did that whole hugging-the-leg, crying, "Mommy, don't get on the plane" thing. 
This is hard. I feel guilty sometimes. 
I know no women, whether they're at home or whether they're in the workforce, who don't feel that sometimes. 
So I'm not saying that staying in the workforce is the right thing for everyone. 
My talk today is about what the messages are if you do want to stay in the workforce, and I think there are three. 
One, sit at the table. 
Two, make your partner a real partner. 
And three, don't leave before you leave. 
Number one: sit at the table. 
Just a couple weeks ago at Facebook, we hosted a very senior government official, and he came in to meet with senior execs from around Silicon Valley. 
And everyone kind of sat at the table. 
He had these two women who were traveling with him pretty senior in his department, and I kind of said to them, "Sit at the table. Come on, sit at the table," and they sat on the side of the room. 
When I was in college, my senior year, I took a course called European Intellectual History. 
Don't you love that kind of thing from college? 
I wish I could do that now. 
And I took it with my roommate, Carrie, who was then a brilliant literary student -- and went on to be a brilliant literary scholar -- and my brother -- smart guy, but a water-polo-playing pre-med, who was a sophomore. 
The three of us take this class together. 
And then Carrie reads all the books in the original Greek and Latin, goes to all the lectures. 
I read all the books in English and go to most of the lectures. 
My brother is kind of busy. 
He reads one book of 12 and goes to a couple of lectures, marches himself up to our room a couple days before the exam to get himself tutored. 
The three of us go to the exam together, and we sit down. 
And we sit there for three hours -- and our little blue notebooks -- yes, I'm that old. 
We walk out, we look at each other, and we say, "How did you do?" 
And Carrie says, "Boy, I feel like I didn't really draw out the main point on the Hegelian dialectic." 
And I say, "God, I really wish I had really connected John Locke's theory of property with the philosophers that follow." 
And my brother says, "I got the top grade in the class." 
(Laughter) "You got the top grade in the class? 
You don't know anything." 
(Laughter) The problem with these stories is that they show what the data shows: women systematically underestimate their own abilities. 
If you test men and women, and you ask them questions on totally objective criteria like GPAs, men get it wrong slightly high, and women get it wrong slightly low. 
Women do not negotiate for themselves in the workforce. 
A study in the last two years of people entering the workforce out of college showed that 57 percent of boys entering, or men, I guess, are negotiating their first salary, and only seven percent of women. 
And most importantly, men attribute their success to themselves, and women attribute it to other external factors. 
If you ask men why they did a good job, they'll say, "I'm awesome. 
Obviously. Why are you even asking?" 
If you ask women why they did a good job, what they'll say is someone helped them, they got lucky, they worked really hard. 
Why does this matter? 
Boy, it matters a lot. 
Because no one gets to the corner office by sitting on the side, not at the table, and no one gets the promotion if they don't think they deserve their success, or they don't even understand their own success. 
I wish the answer were easy. 
I wish I could go tell all the young women I work for, these fabulous women, "Believe in yourself and negotiate for yourself. 
Own your own success." 
I wish I could tell that to my daughter. 
But it's not that simple. 
Because what the data shows, above all else, is one thing, which is that success and likeability are positively correlated for men and negatively correlated for women. 
And everyone's nodding, because we all know this to be true. 
There's a really good study that shows this really well. 
There's a famous Harvard Business School study on a woman named Heidi Roizen. 
And she's an operator in a company in Silicon Valley, and she uses her contacts to become a very successful venture capitalist. 
In 2002 -- not so long ago -- a professor who was then at Columbia University took that case and made it [Howard] Roizen. 
And he gave the case out, both of them, to two groups of students. 
He changed exactly one word: "Heidi" to "Howard." 
But that one word made a really big difference. 
He then surveyed the students, and the good news was the students, both men and women, thought Heidi and Howard were equally competent, and that's good. 
The bad news was that everyone liked Howard. 
He's a great guy. You want to work for him. 
You want to spend the day fishing with him. 
But Heidi? Not so sure. 
She's a little out for herself. She's a little political. 
You're not sure you'd want to work for her. 
This is the complication. 
We have to tell our daughters and our colleagues, we have to tell ourselves to believe we got the A, to reach for the promotion, to sit at the table, and we have to do it in a world where, for them, there are sacrifices they will make for that, even though for their brothers, there are not. 
The saddest thing about all of this is that it's really hard to remember this. 
And I'm about to tell a story which is truly embarrassing for me, but I think important. 
I gave this talk at Facebook not so long ago to about 100 employees, and a couple hours later, there was a young woman who works there sitting outside my little desk, and she wanted to talk to me. 
I said, okay, and she sat down, and we talked. 
And she said, "I learned something today. 
I learned that I need to keep my hand up." 
"What do you mean?" 
She said, "You're giving this talk, and you said you would take two more questions. 
I had my hand up with many other people, and you took two more questions. 
I put my hand down, and I noticed all the women did the same, and then you took more questions, only from the men." 
And I thought to myself, "Wow, if it's me -- who cares about this, obviously -- giving this talk -- and during this talk, I can't even notice that the men's hands are still raised, and the women's hands are still raised, how good are we as managers of our companies and our organizations at seeing that the men are reaching for opportunities more than women?" 
We've got to get women to sit at the table. 
(Cheers) (Applause) Message number two: Make your partner a real partner. 
I've become convinced that we've made more progress in the workforce than we have in the home. 
The data shows this very clearly. 
If a woman and a man work full-time and have a child, the woman does twice the amount of housework the man does, and the woman does three times the amount of childcare the man does. 
So she's got three jobs or two jobs, and he's got one. 
Who do you think drops out when someone needs to be home more? 
The causes of this are really complicated, and I don't have time to go into them. 
And I don't think Sunday football-watching and general laziness is the cause. 
I think the cause is more complicated. 
I think, as a society, we put more pressure on our boys to succeed than we do on our girls. 
I know men that stay home and work in the home to support wives with careers, and it's hard. 
When I go to the Mommy-and-Me stuff and I see the father there, I notice that the other mommies don't play with him. 
And that's a problem, because we have to make it as important a job, because it's the hardest job in the world to work inside the home, for people of both genders, if we're going to even things out and let women stay in the workforce. 
(Applause) Studies show that households with equal earning and equal responsibility also have half the divorce rate. 
And if that wasn't good enough motivation for everyone out there, they also have more -- how shall I say this on this stage? 
They know each other more in the biblical sense as well. 
(Cheers) Message number three: Don't leave before you leave. 
I think there's a really deep irony to the fact that actions women are taking -- and I see this all the time -- with the objective of staying in the workforce actually lead to their eventually leaving. 
Here's what happens: We're all busy. Everyone's busy. A woman's busy. 
And she starts thinking about having a child, and from the moment she starts thinking about having a child, she starts thinking about making room for that child. 
"How am I going to fit this into everything else I'm doing?" 
And literally from that moment, she doesn't raise her hand anymore, she doesn't look for a promotion, she doesn't take on the new project, she doesn't say, "Me. I want to do that." 
She starts leaning back. 
The problem is that -- let's say she got pregnant that day, that day -- nine months of pregnancy, three months of maternity leave, six months to catch your breath -- Fast-forward two years, more often -- and as I've seen it -- women start thinking about this way earlier -- when they get engaged, or married, when they start thinking about having a child, which can take a long time. 
One woman came to see me about this. 
She looked a little young. 
And I said, "So are you and your husband thinking about having a baby?" 
And she said, "Oh no, I'm not married." 
She didn't even have a boyfriend. 
(Laughter) I said, "You're thinking about this just way too early." 
But the point is that what happens once you start kind of quietly leaning back? 
Everyone who's been through this -- and I'm here to tell you, once you have a child at home, your job better be really good to go back, because it's hard to leave that kid at home. 
Your job needs to be challenging. 
It needs to be rewarding. 
You need to feel like you're making a difference. 
And if two years ago you didn't take a promotion and some guy next to you did, if three years ago you stopped looking for new opportunities, you're going to be bored because you should have kept your foot on the gas pedal. 
Don't leave before you leave. 
Stay in. 
Keep your foot on the gas pedal, until the very day you need to leave to take a break for a child -- and then make your decisions. 
Don't make decisions too far in advance, particularly ones you're not even conscious you're making. 
My generation really, sadly, is not going to change the numbers at the top. 
They're just not moving. 
We are not going to get to where 50 percent of the population -- in my generation, there will not be 50 percent of [women] at the top of any industry. 
But I'm hopeful that future generations can. 
I think a world where half of our countries and our companies were run by women, would be a better world. 
It's not just because people would know where the women's bathrooms are, even though that would be very helpful. 
I think it would be a better world. 
I have two children. 
I have a five-year-old son and a two-year-old daughter. 
I want my son to have a choice to contribute fully in the workforce or at home, and I want my daughter to have the choice to not just succeed, but to be liked for her accomplishments. 
Thank you. 
(Applause) 

As a boy, I loved cars. 
When I turned 18, I lost my best friend to a car accident. 
Like this. 
And then I decided I'd dedicate my life to saving one million people every year. 
Now I haven't succeeded, so this is just a progress report, but I'm here to tell you a little bit about self-driving cars. 
I saw the concept first in the DARPA Grand Challenges where the U.S. government issued a prize to build a self-driving car that could navigate a desert. 
And even though a hundred teams were there, these cars went nowhere. 
So we decided at Stanford to build a different self-driving car. 
We built the hardware and the software. 
We made it learn from us, and we set it free in the desert. 
And the unimaginable happened: it became the first car to ever return from a DARPA Grand Challenge, winning Stanford 2 million dollars. 
Yet I still hadn't saved a single life. 
Since, our work has focused on building driving cars that can drive anywhere by themselves -- any street in California. 
We've driven 140,000 miles. 
Our cars have sensors by which they magically can see everything around them and make decisions about every aspect of driving. 
It's the perfect driving mechanism. 
We've driven in cities, like in San Francisco here. 
We've driven from San Francisco to Los Angeles on Highway 1. 
We've encountered joggers, busy highways, toll booths, and this is without a person in the loop; the car just drives itself. 
In fact, while we drove 140,000 miles, people didn't even notice. 
Mountain roads, day and night, and even crooked Lombard Street in San Francisco. 
(Laughter) Sometimes our cars get so crazy, they even do little stunts. 
(Video) Man: Oh, my God. 
What? 
Second Man: It's driving itself. 
Sebastian Thrun: Now I can't get my friend Harold back to life, but I can do something for all the people who died. 
Do you know that driving accidents are the number one cause of death for young people? 
And do you realize that almost all of those are due to human error and not machine error, and can therefore be prevented by machines? 
Do you realize that we could change the capacity of highways by a factor of two or three if we didn't rely on human precision on staying in the lane -- improve body position and therefore drive a little bit closer together on a little bit narrower lanes, and do away with all traffic jams on highways? 
Do you realize that you, TED users, spend an average of 52 minutes per day in traffic, wasting your time on your daily commute? 
You could regain this time. 
This is four billion hours wasted in this country alone. 
And it's 2.4 billion gallons of gasoline wasted. 
Now I think there's a vision here, a new technology, and I'm really looking forward to a time when generations after us look back at us and say how ridiculous it was that humans were driving cars. 
Thank you. 
(Applause) 

(Music) (Applause) (Music) (Applause) 

It is a dream of mankind to fly like a bird. 
Birds are very agile. 
They fly, not with rotating components, so they fly only by flapping their wings. 
So we looked at the birds, and we tried to make a model that is powerful, ultralight, and it must have excellent aerodynamic qualities that would fly by its own and only by flapping its wings. 
So what would be better than to use the herring gull, in its freedom, circling and swooping over the sea, and to use this as a role model? 
So we bring a team together. 
There are generalists and also specialists in the field of aerodynamics, in the field of building gliders. 
And the task was to build an ultralight indoor-flying model that is able to fly over your heads. 
So be careful later on. 
(Laughter) And this was one issue: to build it that lightweight that no one would be hurt if it fell down. 
So why do we do all this? 
We are a company in the field of automation, and we'd like to do very lightweight structures because that's energy efficient, and we'd like to learn more about pneumatics and air flow phenomena. 
So I now would like you to put your seat belts on and put your hats on. 
So maybe we'll try it once -- to fly a SmartBird. 
Thank you. 
(Applause) (Cheers) (Applause) (Applause ends) (Applause) So we can now look at the SmartBird. 
So here is one without a skin. 
We have a wingspan of about two meters. 
The length is one meter and six, and the weight is only 450 grams. 
And it is all out of carbon fiber. 
In the middle we have a motor, and we also have a gear in it, and we use the gear to transfer the circulation of the motor. 
So within the motor, we have three Hall sensors, so we know exactly where the wing is. 
And if we now beat up and down -- (Mechanical sounds) We have the possibility to fly like a bird. 
So if you go down, you have the large area of propulsion, and if you go up, the wings are not that large, and it is easier to get up. 
So, the next thing we did, or the challenges we did, was to coordinate this movement. 
We have to turn it, go up and go down. 
We have a split wing. 
With the split wing, we get the lift at the upper wing, and we get the propulsion at the lower wing. 
Also, we see how we measure the aerodynamic efficiency. 
We had knowledge about the electromechanical efficiency and then we can calculate the aerodynamic efficiency. 
So therefore, it rises up from passive torsion to active torsion, from 30 percent up to 80 percent. 
Next thing we have to do, we have to control and regulate the whole structure. 
Only if you control and regulate it, you will get that aerodynamic efficiency. 
So the overall consumption of energy is about 25 watts at takeoff and 16 to 18 watts in flight. 
Thank you. 
(Applause) Bruno Giussani: Markus, we should fly it once more. 
Markus Fischer: Yeah, sure. 
(Audience) Yeah! 
(Laughter) (Gasps) (Cheers) (Applause) 

Consider the following statement: human beings only use 10 percent of their brain capacity. 
Well, as a neuroscientist, I can tell you that while Morgan Freeman delivered this line with the gravitas that makes him a great actor, this statement is entirely false. 
(Laughter) The truth is, human beings use 100 percent of their brain capacity. 
The brain is a highly efficient, energy-demanding organ that gets fully utilized and even though it is at full capacity being used, it suffers from a problem of information overload. 
There's far too much in the environment than it can fully process. 
So to solve this problem of overload, evolution devised a solution, which is the brain's attention system. 
Attention allows us to notice, select and direct the brain's computational resources to a subset of all that's available. 
We can think of attention as the leader of the brain. 
Wherever attention goes, the rest of the brain follows. 
In some sense, it's your brain's boss. 
And over the last 15 years, I've been studying the human brain's attention system. 
In all of our studies, I've been very interested in one question. 
If it is indeed the case that our attention is the brain's boss, is it a good boss? 
Does it actually guide us well? 
And to dig in on this big question, I wanted to know three things. 
First, how does attention control our perception? 
Second, why does it fail us, often leaving us feeling foggy and distracted? 
And third, can we do anything about this fogginess, can we train our brain to pay better attention? 
To have more strong and stable attention in the work that we do in our lives. 
So I wanted to give you a brief glimpse into how we're going to look at this. 
A very poignant example of how our attention ends up getting utilized. 
And I want to do it using the example of somebody that I know quite well. 
He ends up being part of a very large group of people that we work with, for whom attention is a matter of life and death. 
Think of medical professionals or firefighters or soldiers or marines. 
This is the story of a marine captain, Captain Jeff Davis. 
And the scene that I'm going to share with you, as you can see, is not about his time in the battlefield. 
He was actually on a bridge, in Florida. 
But instead of looking at the scenery around him, seeing the beautiful vistas and noticing the cool ocean breezes, he was driving fast and contemplating driving off that bridge. 
And he would later tell me that it took all of everything he had not to do so. 
You see, he'd just returned from Iraq. 
And while his body was on that bridge, his mind, his attention, was thousands of miles away. 
He was gripped with suffering. 
His mind was worried and preoccupied and had stressful memories and, really, dread for his future. 
And I'm really glad that he didn't take his life. 
Because he, as a leader, knew that he wasn't the only one that was probably suffering; many of his fellow marines probably were, too. 
And in the year 2008, he partnered with me in the first-of-its-kind project that actually allowed us to test and offer something called mindfulness training to active-duty military personnel. 
But before I tell you about what mindfulness training is, or the results of that study, I think it's important to understand how attention works in the brain. 
So what we do in the laboratory is that many of our studies of attention involve brain-wave recordings. 
In these brain wave recordings, people wear funny-looking caps that are sort of like swimming caps, that have electrodes embedded in them. 
These electrodes pick up the ongoing brain electrical activity. 
And they do it with millisecond temporal precision. 
So we can see these small yet detectable voltage fluctuations over time. 
And doing this, we can very precisely plot the timing of the brain's activity. 
About 170 milliseconds after we show our research participants a face on the screen, we see a very reliable, detectable brain signature. 
It happens right at the back of the scalp, above the regions of the brain that are involved in face processing. 
Now, this happens so reliably and so on cue, as the brain's face detector, that we've even given this brain-wave component a name. 
We call it the N170 component. 
And we use this component in many of our studies. 
It allows us to see the impact that attention may have on our perception. 
I'm going to give you a sense of the kind of experiments that we actually do in the lab. 
We would show participants images like this one. 
You should see a face and a scene overlaid on each other. 
And what we do is we ask our participants as they're viewing a series of these types of overlaid images, to do something with their attention. 
On some trials, we'll ask them to pay attention to the face. 
And to make sure they're doing that, we ask them to tell us, by pressing a button, if the face appeared to be male or female. 
On other trials, we ask them to tell what the scene was -- was it indoor or outdoor? 
And in this way, we can manipulate attention and confirm that the participants were actually doing what we said. 
Our hypotheses about attention were as follows: if attention is indeed doing its job and affecting perception, maybe it works like an amplifier. 
And what I mean by this is that when we direct attention to the face, it becomes clearer and more salient, it's easier to see. 
But when we direct it to the scene, the face becomes barely perceptible as we process the scene information. 
So what we wanted to do is look at this brain-wave component of face detection, the N170, and see if it changed at all as a function of where our participants were paying attention -- to the scene or the face. 
And here's what we found. 
We found that when they paid attention to the face, the N170 was larger. 
And when they paid attention to the scene, as you can see in red, it was smaller. 
And that gap you see between the blue and red lines is pretty powerful. 
What it tells us is that attention, which is really the only thing that changed, since the images they viewed were identical in both cases -- attention changes perception. 
And it does so very fast. 
Within 170 milliseconds of actually seeing a face. 
In our follow-up studies, we wanted to see what would happen, how could we perturb or diminish this effect. 
And our hunch was that if you put people in a very stressful environment, if you distract them with disturbing, negative images, images of suffering and violence -- sort of like what you might see on the news, unfortunately -- that doing this might actually affect their attention. 
And that's indeed what we found. 
If we present stressful images while they're doing this experiment, this gap of attention shrinks, its power diminishes. 
So in some of our other studies, we wanted to see, OK, great -- not great, actually, bad news that stress does this to the brain -- but if it is the case that stress has this powerful influence on attention through external distraction, what if we don't need external distraction, what if we distract ourselves? 
And to do this, we had to basically come up with an experiment in which we could have people generate their own mind-wandering. 
This is having off-task thoughts while we're engaged in an ongoing task of some sort. 
And the trick to mind-wandering is that essentially, you bore people. 
So hopefully there's not a lot of mind-wandering happening right now. 
When we bore people, people happily generate all kinds of internal content to occupy themselves. 
So we devised what might be considered one of the world's most boring experiments. 
All the participants saw were a series of faces on the screen, one after another. 
They pressed the button every time they saw the face. 
That was pretty much it. 
Well, one trick was that sometimes, the face would be upside down, and it would happen very infrequently. 
On those trials they were told just to withhold the response. 
Pretty soon, we could tell that they were successfully mind-wandering, because they pressed the button when that face was upside down. 
Even though it's quite plain to see that it was upside down. 
So we wanted to know what happens when people have mind-wandering. 
And what we found was that, very similar to external stress and external distraction in the environment, internal distraction, our own mind wandering, also shrinks the gap of attention. 
It diminishes attention's power. 
So what do all of these studies tell us? 
They tell us that attention is very powerful in terms of affecting our perception. 
Even though it's so powerful, it's also fragile and vulnerable. 
And things like stress and mind-wandering diminish its power. 
But that's all in the context of these very controlled laboratory settings. 
What about in the real world? 
What about in our actual day-to-day life? 
What about now? 
Where is your attention right now? 
To kind of bring it back, I'd like to make a prediction about your attention for the remainder of my talk. 
Are you up for it? 
Here's the prediction. 
You will be unaware of what I'm saying for four out of the next eight minutes. 
(Laughter) It's a challenge, so pay attention, please. 
Now, why am I saying this? 
I'm surely going to assume that you're going to remain seated and, you know, graciously keep your eyes on me as I speak. 
But a growing body of literature suggests that we mind-wander, we take our mind away from the task at hand, about 50 percent of our waking moments. 
These might be small, little trips that we take away, private thoughts that we have. 
And when this mind-wandering happens, it can be problematic. 
Now I don't think there will be any dire consequences with you all sitting here today, but imagine a military leader missing four minutes of a military briefing, or a judge missing four minutes of testimony. 
Or a surgeon or firefighter missing any time. 
The consequences in those cases could be dire. 
So we might ask why do we do this? 
Why do we mind-wander so much? 
Well, part of the answer is that our mind is an exquisite time-traveling master. 
It can actually time travel very easily. 
If we think of the mind as the metaphor of the music player, we see this. 
We can rewind the mind to the past to reflect on events that have already happened, right? 
Or we can go and fast-future, to plan for the next thing that we want to do. 
And we land in this mental time-travel mode of the past or the future very frequently. 
And we land there often without our awareness, most times without our awareness, even if we want to be paying attention. 
Think of just the last time you were trying to read a book, got to the bottom of the page with no idea what the words were saying. 
This happens to us. 
And when this happens, when we mind-wander without an awareness that we're doing it, there are consequences. 
We make errors. 
We miss critical information, sometimes. 
And we have difficulty making decisions. 
What's worse is when we experience stress. 
When we're in a moment of overwhelm. 
We don't just reflect on the past when we rewind, we end up being in the past ruminating, reliving or regretting events that have already happened. 
Or under stress, we fast-forward the mind. 
Not just to productively plan. 
But we end up catastrophizing or worrying about events that haven't happened yet and frankly may never happen. 
So at this point, you might be thinking to yourself, OK, mind-wandering's happening a lot. 
Often, it happens without our awareness. 
And under stress, it's even worse -- we mind-wander more powerfully and more often. 
Is there anything we can possibly do about this? 
And I'm happy to say the answer is yes. 
From our work, we're learning that the opposite of a stressed and wandering mind is a mindful one. 
Mindfulness has to do with paying attention to our present-moment experience with awareness. 
And without any kind of emotional reactivity of what's happening. 
It's about keeping that button right on play to experience the moment-to-moment unfolding of our lives. 
And mindfulness is not just a concept. 
It's more like practice, you have to embody this mindful mode of being to have any benefits. 
And a lot of the work that we're doing, we're offering people programs that give our participants a suite of exercises that they should do daily in order to cultivate more moments of mindfulness in their life. 
And for many of the groups that we work with, high-stress groups, like I said -- soldiers, medical professionals -- for them, as we know, mind-wandering can be really dire. 
So we want to make sure we offer them very accessible, low time constraints to optimize the training, so they can benefit from it. 
And when we do this, what we can do is track to see what happens, not just in their regular lives but in the most demanding circumstances that they may have. 
Why do we want to do this? 
Well, we want to, for example, give it to students right around finals season. 
Or we want to give the training to accountants during tax season. 
Or soldiers and marines while they're deploying. 
Why is that? 
Because those are the moments in which their attention is most likely to be vulnerable, because of stress and mind-wandering. 
And those are also the moments in which we want their attention to be in peak shape so they can perform well. 
So what we do in our research is we have them take a series of attention tests. 
We track their attention at the beginning of some kind of high-stress interval, and then two months later, we track them again, and we want to see if there's a difference. 
Is there any benefit of offering them mindfulness training? 
Can we protect against the lapses in attention that might arise over high stress? 
So here's what we find. 
Over a high-stress interval, unfortunately, the reality is if we don't do anything at all, attention declines, people are worse at the end of this high-stress interval than before. 
But if we offer mindfulness training, we can protect against this. 
They stay stable, even though just like the other groups, they were experiencing high stress. 
And perhaps even more impressive is that if people take our training programs over, let's say, eight weeks, and they fully commit to doing the daily mindfulness exercises that allow them to learn how to be in the present moment, well, they actually get better over time, even though they're in high stress. 
And this last point is actually important to realize, because of what it suggests to us is that mindfulness exercises are very much like physical exercise: if you don't do it, you don't benefit. 
But if you do engage in mindfulness practice, the more you do, the more you benefit. 
And I want to just bring it back to Captain Jeff Davis. 
As I mentioned to you at the beginning, his marines were involved in the very first project that we ever did, offering mindfulness training. 
And they showed this exact pattern, which was very heartening. 
We had offered them the mindfulness training right before they were deployed to Iraq. 
And upon their return, Captain Davis shared with us what he was feeling was the benefit of this program. 
He said that unlike last time, after this deployment, they were much more present. 
They were discerning. 
They were not as reactive. 
And in some cases, they were really more compassionate with the people they were engaging with and each other. 
He said in many ways, he felt that the mindfulness training program we offered gave them a really important tool to protect against developing post-traumatic stress disorder and even allowing it to turn into post-traumatic growth. 
To us, this was very compelling. 
And it ended up that Captain Davis and I -- you know, this was about a decade ago, in 2008 -- we've kept in touch all these years. 
And he himself has gone on to continue practicing mindfulness in a daily way. 
He was promoted to major, he actually then ended up retiring from the Marine Corps. 
He went on to get a divorce, to get remarried, to have a child, to get an MBA. 
And through all of these challenges and transitions and joys of his life, he kept up with his mindfulness practice. 
And as fate would have it, just a few months ago, Captain Davis suffered a massive heart attack, at the age of 46. 
And he ended up calling me a few weeks ago. 
And he said, "I want to tell you something. 
I know that the doctors who worked on me, they saved my heart, but mindfulness saved my life. 
The presence of mind I had to stop the ambulance that ended up taking me to the hospital," -- himself, the clarity of mind he had to notice when there was fear and anxiety happening but not be gripped by it -- he said, "For me, these were the gifts of mindfulness." 
And I was so relieved to hear that he was OK. 
But really heartened to see that he had transformed his own attention. 
He went from having a really bad boss -- an attention system that nearly drove him off a bridge -- to one that was an exquisite leader and guide, and saved his life. 
So I want to actually end by sharing my call to action to all of you. 
And here it is. 
Pay attention to your attention. 
Alright? 
Pay attention to your attention and incorporate mindfulness training as part of your daily wellness toolkit, in order to tame your own wandering mind and to allow your attention to be a trusted guide in your own life. 
Thank you. 
(Applause) 

I consider myself one part artist and one part designer. 
And I work at an artificial intelligence research lab. 
We're trying to create technology that you'll want to interact with in the far future. 
Not just six months from now, but try years and decades from now. 
And we're taking a moonshot that we'll want to be interacting with computers in deeply emotional ways. 
So in order to do that, the technology has to be just as much human as it is artificial. 
It has to get you. 
You know, like that inside joke that'll have you and your best friend on the floor, cracking up. 
Or that look of disappointment that you can just smell from miles away. 
I view art as the gateway to help us bridge this gap between human and machine: to figure out what it means to get each other so that we can train AI to get us. 
See, to me, art is a way to put tangible experiences to intangible ideas, feelings and emotions. 
And I think it's one of the most human things about us. 
See, we're a complicated and complex bunch. 
We have what feels like an infinite range of emotions, and to top it off, we're all different. 
We have different family backgrounds, different experiences and different psychologies. 
And this is what makes life really interesting. 
But this is also what makes working on intelligent technology extremely difficult. 
And right now, AI research, well, it's a bit lopsided on the tech side. 
And that makes a lot of sense. 
See, for every qualitative thing about us -- you know, those parts of us that are emotional, dynamic and subjective -- we have to convert it to a quantitative metric: something that can be represented with facts, figures and computer code. 
The issue is, there are many qualitative things that we just can't put our finger on. 
So, think about hearing your favorite song for the first time. 
What were you doing? 
How did you feel? 
Did you get goosebumps? 
Or did you get fired up? 
Hard to describe, right? 
See, parts of us feel so simple, but under the surface, there's really a ton of complexity. 
And translating that complexity to machines is what makes them modern-day moonshots. 
And I'm not convinced that we can answer these deeper questions with just ones and zeros alone. 
So, in the lab, I've been creating art as a way to help me design better experiences for bleeding-edge technology. 
And it's been serving as a catalyst to beef up the more human ways that computers can relate to us. 
Through art, we're tacking some of the hardest questions, like what does it really mean to feel? 
Or how do we engage and know how to be present with each other? 
And how does intuition affect the way that we interact? 
So, take for example human emotion. 
Right now, computers can make sense of our most basic ones, like joy, sadness, anger, fear and disgust, by converting those characteristics to math. 
But what about the more complex emotions? 
You know, those emotions that we have a hard time describing to each other? 
Like nostalgia. 
So, to explore this, I created a piece of art, an experience, that asked people to share a memory, and I teamed up with some data scientists to figure out how to take an emotion that's so highly subjective and convert it into something mathematically precise. 
So, we created what we call a nostalgia score and it's the heart of this installation. 
To do that, the installation asks you to share a story, the computer then analyzes it for its simpler emotions, it checks for your tendency to use past-tense wording and also looks for words that we tend to associate with nostalgia, like "home," "childhood" and "the past." 
It then creates a nostalgia score to indicate how nostalgic your story is. 
And that score is the driving force behind these light-based sculptures that serve as physical embodiments of your contribution. 
And the higher the score, the rosier the hue. 
You know, like looking at the world through rose-colored glasses. 
So, when you see your score and the physical representation of it, sometimes you'd agree and sometimes you wouldn't. 
It's as if it really understood how that experience made you feel. 
But other times it gets tripped up and has you thinking it doesn't understand you at all. 
But the piece really serves to show that if we have a hard time explaining the emotions that we have to each other, how can we teach a computer to make sense of them? 
So, even the more objective parts about being human are hard to describe. 
Like, conversation. 
Have you ever really tried to break down the steps? 
So think about sitting with your friend at a coffee shop and just having small talk. 
How do you know when to take a turn? 
How do you know when to shift topics? 
And how do you even know what topics to discuss? 
See, most of us don't really think about it, because it's almost second nature. 
And when we get to know someone, we learn more about what makes them tick, and then we learn what topics we can discuss. 
But when it comes to teaching AI systems how to interact with people, we have to teach them step by step what to do. 
And right now, it feels clunky. 
If you've ever tried to talk with Alexa, Siri or Google Assistant, you can tell that it or they can still sound cold. 
And have you ever gotten annoyed when they didn't understand what you were saying and you had to rephrase what you wanted 20 times just to play a song? 
Alright, to the credit of the designers, realistic communication is really hard. 
And there's a whole branch of sociology, called conversation analysis, that tries to make blueprints for different types of conversation. 
Types like customer service or counseling, teaching and others. 
I've been collaborating with a conversation analyst at the lab to try to help our AI systems hold more human-sounding conversations. 
This way, when you have an interaction with a chatbot on your phone or a voice-based system in the car, it sounds a little more human and less cold and disjointed. 
So I created a piece of art that tries to highlight the robotic, clunky interaction to help us understand, as designers, why it doesn't sound human yet and, well, what we can do about it. 
The piece is called Bot to Bot and it puts one conversational system against another and then exposes it to the general public. 
And what ends up happening is that you get something that tries to mimic human conversation, but falls short. 
Sometimes it works and sometimes it gets into these, well, loops of misunderstanding. 
So even though the machine-to-machine conversation can make sense, grammatically and colloquially, it can still end up feeling cold and robotic. 
And despite checking all the boxes, the dialogue lacks soul and those one-off quirks that make each of us who we are. 
So while it might be grammatically correct and uses all the right hashtags and emojis, it can end up sounding mechanical and, well, a little creepy. 
And we call this the uncanny valley. 
You know, that creepiness factor of tech where it's close to human but just slightly off. 
And the piece will start being one way that we test for the humanness of a conversation and the parts that get lost in translation. 
So there are other things that get lost in translation, too, like human intuition. 
Right now, computers are gaining more autonomy. 
They can take care of things for us, like change the temperature of our houses based on our preferences and even help us drive on the freeway. 
But there are things that you and I do in person that are really difficult to translate to AI. 
So think about the last time that you saw an old classmate or coworker. 
Did you give them a hug or go in for a handshake? 
You probably didn't think twice because you've had so many built up experiences that had you do one or the other. 
And as an artist, I feel that access to one's intuition, your unconscious knowing, is what helps us create amazing things. 
Big ideas, from that abstract, nonlinear place in our consciousness that is the culmination of all of our experiences. 
And if we want computers to relate to us and help amplify our creative abilities, I feel that we'll need to start thinking about how to make computers be intuitive. 
So I wanted to explore how something like human intuition could be directly translated to artificial intelligence. 
And I created a piece that explores computer-based intuition in a physical space. 
The piece is called Wayfinding, and it's set up as a symbolic compass that has four kinetic sculptures. 
Each one represents a direction, north, east, south and west. 
And there are sensors set up on the top of each sculpture that capture how far away you are from them. 
And the data that gets collected ends up changing the way that sculptures move and the direction of the compass. 
The thing is, the piece doesn't work like the automatic door sensor that just opens when you walk in front of it. 
See, your contribution is only a part of its collection of lived experiences. 
And all of those experiences affect the way that it moves. 
So when you walk in front of it, it starts to use all of the data that it's captured throughout its exhibition history -- or its intuition -- to mechanically respond to you based on what it's learned from others. 
And what ends up happening is that as participants we start to learn the level of detail that we need in order to manage expectations from both humans and machines. 
We can almost see our intuition being played out on the computer, picturing all of that data being processed in our mind's eye. 
My hope is that this type of art will help us think differently about intuition and how to apply that to AI in the future. 
So these are just a few examples of how I'm using art to feed into my work as a designer and researcher of artificial intelligence. 
And I see it as a crucial way to move innovation forward. 
Because right now, there are a lot of extremes when it comes to AI. 
Popular movies show it as this destructive force while commercials are showing it as a savior to solve some of the world's most complex problems. 
But regardless of where you stand, it's hard to deny that we're living in a world that's becoming more and more digital by the second. 
Our lives revolve around our devices, smart appliances and more. 
And I don't think this will let up any time soon. 
So, I'm trying to embed more humanness from the start. 
And I have a hunch that bringing art into an AI research process is a way to do just that. 
Thank you. 
(Applause) 

I've always had a fascination for computers and technology, and I made a few apps for the iPhone, iPod touch, and iPad. 
I'd like to share a couple with you today. 
My first app was a unique fortune teller called "Earth Fortune" that would display different colors of Earth depending on what your fortune was. 
My favorite and most successful app is "Bustin Jieber," which is -- (Laughter) which is a Justin Bieber whack-a-mole. 
(Laughter) I created it because a lot of people at school disliked Justin Bieber a little bit, so I decided to make the app. 
So I went to work programming it, and I released it just before the holidays in 2010. 
A lot of people ask me, how did I make these? 
A lot of times it's because the person who asked the question wants to make an app also. 
A lot of kids these days like to play games, but now they want to make them, and it's difficult, because not many kids know where to go to find out how to make a program. 
I mean, for soccer, you could go to a soccer team. 
For violin, you could get lessons for a violin. 
But what if you want to make an app? 
And the kid's parents might have done some of these things when they were young, but not many parents have written apps. 
(Laughter) Where do you go to find out how to make an app? 
Well, this is how I approached it, this is what I did. 
First of all, I've been programming in multiple other programming languages to get the basics down, such as Python, C, Java, etc. 
And then Apple released the iPhone, and with it, the iPhone software development kit, and the software development kit is a suite of tools for creating and programming an iPhone app. 
This opened up a whole new world of possibilities for me, and after playing with the software development kit a little bit, I made a couple of apps, I made some test apps. 
One of them happened to be "Earth Fortune," and I was ready to put "Earth Fortune" on the App Store, and so I persuaded my parents to pay the 99 dollar fee to be able to put my apps on the App Store. 
They agreed, and now I have apps on the App Store. 
I've gotten a lot of interest and encouragement from my family, friends, teachers and even people at the Apple Store, and that's been a huge help to me. 
I've gotten a lot of inspiration from Steve Jobs, and I've started an app club at school, and a teacher at my school is kindly sponsoring my app club. 
Any student at my school can come and learn how to design an app. 
This is so I can share my experiences with others. 
There's these programs called the iPad Pilot Program, and some districts have them. 
I'm fortunate enough to be part of one. 
A big challenge is, how should the iPads be used, and what apps should we put on the iPads? 
So we're getting feedback from teachers at the school to see what kind of apps they'd like. 
When we design the app and we sell it, it will be free to local districts; and other districts that we sell to -- all the money from that will go into the local ed foundations. 
These days, students usually know a little bit more than teachers with the technology. 
(Laughter) So -- (Laughter) Sorry. 
(Laughter) So this is a resource to teachers, and educators should recognize this resource and make good use of it. 
(Laughter) I'd like to finish up by saying what I'd like to do in the future. 
First of all, I'd like to create more apps, more games. 
I'm working with a third party company to make an app. 
I'd like to get into Android programming and development, and I'd like to continue my app club, and find other ways for students to share knowledge with others. 
Thank you. 
(Applause) 

What I'm going to show you first, as quickly as I can, is some foundational work, some new technology that we brought to Microsoft as part of an acquisition almost exactly a year ago. 
This is Seadragon, and it's an environment in which you can either locally or remotely interact with vast amounts of visual data. 
We're looking at many, many gigabytes of digital photos here and kind of seamlessly and continuously zooming in, panning through it, rearranging it in any way we want. 
And it doesn't matter how much information we're looking at, how big these collections are or how big the images are. 
Most of them are ordinary digital camera photos, but this one, for example, is a scan from the Library of Congress, and it's in the 300 megapixel range. 
It doesn't make any difference because the only thing that ought to limit the performance of a system like this one is the number of pixels on your screen at any given moment. 
It's also very flexible architecture. 
This is an entire book, so this is an example of non-image data. 
This is "Bleak House" by Dickens. 
Every column is a chapter. 
To prove to you that it's really text, and not an image, we can do something like so, to really show that this is a real representation of the text; it's not a picture. 
Maybe this is an artificial way to read an e-book. 
I wouldn't recommend it. 
This is a more realistic case, an issue of The Guardian. 
Every large image is the beginning of a section. 
And this really gives you the joy and the good experience of reading the real paper version of a magazine or a newspaper, which is an inherently multi-scale kind of medium. 
We've done something with the corner of this particular issue of The Guardian. 
We've made up a fake ad that's very high resolution -- much higher than in an ordinary ad -- and we've embedded extra content. 
If you want to see the features of this car, you can see it here. 
Or other models, or even technical specifications. 
And this really gets at some of these ideas about really doing away with those limits on screen real estate. 
We hope that this means no more pop-ups and other rubbish like that -- shouldn't be necessary. 
Of course, mapping is one of those obvious applications for a technology like this. 
And this one I really won't spend any time on, except to say that we have things to contribute to this field as well. 
But those are all the roads in the U.S. 
superimposed on top of a NASA geospatial image. 
So let's pull up, now, something else. 
This is actually live on the Web now; you can go check it out. 
This is a project called Photosynth, which marries two different technologies. 
One of them is Seadragon and the other is some very beautiful computer-vision research done by Noah Snavely, a graduate student at the University of Washington, co-advised by Steve Seitz at U.W. 
and Rick Szeliski at Microsoft Research. 
A very nice collaboration. 
And so this is live on the Web. It's powered by Seadragon. 
You can see that when we do these sorts of views, where we can dive through images and have this kind of multi-resolution experience. 
But the spatial arrangement of the images here is actually meaningful. 
The computer vision algorithms have registered these images together so that they correspond to the real space in which these shots -- all taken near Grassi Lakes in the Canadian Rockies -- all these shots were taken. 
So you see elements here of stabilized slide-show or panoramic imaging, and these things have all been related spatially. 
I'm not sure if I have time to show you any other environments. 
Some are much more spatial. 
I would like to jump straight to one of Noah's original data-sets -- this is from an early prototype that we first got working this summer -- to show you what I think is really the punch line behind the Photosynth technology, It's not necessarily so apparent from looking at the environments we've put up on the website. 
We had to worry about the lawyers and so on. 
This is a reconstruction of Notre Dame Cathedral that was done entirely computationally from images scraped from Flickr. 
You just type Notre Dame into Flickr, and you get some pictures of guys in T-shirts, and of the campus and so on. 
And each of these orange cones represents an image that was discovered to belong to this model. 
And so these are all Flickr images, and they've all been related spatially in this way. 
We can just navigate in this very simple way. 
(Applause) (Applause ends) You know, I never thought that I'd end up working at Microsoft. 
It's very gratifying to have this kind of reception here. 
(Laughter) I guess you can see this is lots of different types of cameras: it's everything from cell-phone cameras to professional SLRs, quite a large number of them, stitched together in this environment. 
If I can find some of the sort of weird ones -- So many of them are occluded by faces, and so on. 
Somewhere in here there is actually a series of photographs -- here we go. 
This is actually a poster of Notre Dame that registered correctly. 
We can dive in from the poster to a physical view of this environment. 
What the point here really is is that we can do things with the social environment. 
This is now taking data from everybody -- from the entire collective memory, visually, of what the Earth looks like -- and link all of that together. 
Those photos become linked, and they make something emergent that's greater than the sum of the parts. 
You have a model that emerges of the entire Earth. 
Think of this as the long tail to Stephen Lawler's Virtual Earth work. 
And this is something that grows in complexity as people use it, and whose benefits become greater to the users as they use it. 
Their own photos are getting tagged with meta-data that somebody else entered. 
If somebody bothered to tag all of these saints and say who they all are, then my photo of Notre Dame Cathedral suddenly gets enriched with all of that data, and I can use it as an entry point to dive into that space, into that meta-verse, using everybody else's photos, and do a kind of a cross-modal and cross-user social experience that way. 
And of course, a by-product of all of that is immensely rich virtual models of every interesting part of the Earth, collected not just from overhead flights and from satellite images and so on, but from the collective memory. 
Thank you so much. 
(Applause) (Applause ends) Chris Anderson: Do I understand this right? 
What your software is going to allow, is that at some point, really within the next few years, all the pictures that are shared by anyone across the world are going to link together? 
BAA: Yes. What this is really doing is discovering, creating hyperlinks, if you will, between images. 
It's doing that based on the content inside the images. 
And that gets really exciting when you think about the richness of the semantic information a lot of images have. 
Like when you do a web search for images, you type in phrases, and the text on the web page is carrying a lot of information about what that picture is of. 
What if that picture links to all of your pictures? 
The amount of semantic interconnection and richness that comes out of that is really huge. 
It's a classic network effect. 
CA: Truly incredible. Congratulations. 

I've spent the last decade subjecting myself to pain and humiliation, hopefully for a good cause, which is self-improvement. 
And I've done this in three parts. 
So first I started with the mind. 
And I decided to try to get smarter by reading the entire Encyclopedia Britannica from A to Z -- or, more precisely, from "a-ak" to "Zywiec." 
And here's a little image of that. 
And this was an amazing year. 
It was really a fascinating journey. 
It was painful at times, especially for those around me. 
My wife started to fine me one dollar for every irrelevant fact I inserted into conversation. 
So it had its downsides. 
But after that, I decided to work on the spirit. 
As I mentioned last year, I grew up with no religion at all. 
I'm Jewish, but I'm Jewish in the same way the Olive Garden is Italian. 
(Laughter) Not really. 
But I decided to learn about the Bible and my heritage by actually diving in and trying to live it and immerse myself in it. 
So I decided to follow all the rules of the Bible. 
And from the Ten Commandments to growing my beard -- because Leviticus says you cannot shave. 
So this is what I looked like by the end. 
Thank you for that reaction. 
(Laughter) I look a little like Moses, or Ted Kaczynski. 
I got both of them. 
So there was the topiary there. 
And there's the sheep. 
Now the final part of the trilogy was I wanted to focus on the body and try to be the healthiest person I could be, the healthiest person alive. 
So that's what I've been doing the last couple of years. 
And I just finished a couple of months ago. 
And I have to say, thank God. 
Because living so healthily was killing me. 
(Laughter) It was so overwhelming, because the amount of things you have to do, it's just mind-boggling. 
I was listening to all the experts and talking to sort of a board of medical advisers. 
And they were telling me all the things I had to do. 
I had to eat right, exercise, meditate, pet dogs, because that lowers the blood pressure. 
I wrote the book on a treadmill, and it took me about a thousand miles to write the book. 
I had to put on sunscreen. 
This was no small feat, because if you listen to dermatologists, they say that you should have a shot glass full of sunscreen. 
And you have to reapply it every two to four hours. 
So I think half of my book advance went into sunscreen. 
I was like a glazed doughnut for most of the year. 
There was the washing of hands. 
I had to do that properly. 
And my immunologist told me that I should also wipe down all of the remote controls and iPhones in my house, because those are just orgies of germs. 
So that took a lot of time. 
I also tried to be the safest person I could be, because that's a part of health. 
I was inspired by the Danish Safety Council. 
They started a public campaign that says, "A walking helmet is a good helmet." 
So they believe you should not just wear helmets for biking, but also for walking around. 
And you can see there they're shopping with their helmets. 
(Laughter) Well yeah, I tried that. 
Now it's a little extreme, I admit. 
But if you think about this, this is actually -- the "Freakonomics" authors wrote about this -- that more people die on a per mile basis from drunk walking than from drunk driving. 
So something to think about tonight if you've had a couple. 
So I finished, and it was a success in a sense. 
All of the markers went in the right direction. 
My cholesterol went down, I lost weight, my wife stopped telling me that I looked pregnant. 
So that was nice. 
And it was successful overall. 
But I also learned that I was too healthy, and that was unhealthy. 
I was so focused on doing all these things that I was neglecting my friends and family. 
And as Dan Buettner can tell you, having a strong social network is so crucial to our health. 
So I finished. 
And I kind of went overboard on the week after the project was over. 
I went to the dark side, and I just indulged myself. 
It was like something out of Caligula. 
(Laughter) Without the sex part. 
Because I have three young kids, so that wasn't happening. 
But the over-eating and over-drinking, definitely. 
And I finally have stabilized. 
So now I'm back to adopting many -- not all; I don't wear a helmet anymore -- but dozens of healthy behaviors that I adopted during my year. 
It was really a life-changing project. 
And I, of course, don't have time to go into all of them. 
Let me just tell you two really quickly. 
The first is -- and this was surprising to me; I didn't expect this to come out -- but I live a much quieter life now. 
Because we live in such a noisy world. 
There's trains and planes and cars and Bill O'Reilly, he's very noisy. 
(Laughter) And this is a real underestimated, under-appreciated health hazard -- not just because it harms our hearing, which it obviously does, but it actually initiates the fight-or-flight response. 
A loud noise will get your fight-or-flight response going. 
And this, over the years, can cause real damage, cardiovascular damage. 
The World Health Organization just did a big study that they published this year. 
And it was done in Europe. 
And they estimated that 1.6 million years of healthy living are lost every year in Europe because of noise pollution. 
So they think it's actually very deadly. 
And by the way, it's also terrible for your brain. 
It really impairs cognition. 
And our Founding Fathers knew about this. 
When they wrote the Constitution, they put dirt all over the cobblestones outside the hall so that they could concentrate. 
So without noise reduction technology, our country would not exist. 
So as a patriot, I felt it was important to -- I wear all the earplugs and the earphones, and it's really improved my life in a surprising and unexpected way. 
And the second point I want to make, the final point, is that -- and it's actually been a theme of TEDMED -- that joy is so important to your health, that very few of these behaviors will stick with me unless there's some sense of pleasure and joy in them. 
And just to give you one instance of this: food. 
The junk food industry is really great at pressing our pleasure buttons and figuring out what's the most pleasurable. 
But I think we can use their techniques and apply them to healthy food. 
To give just one example, we love crunchiness, mouthfeel. 
So I basically have tried to incorporate crunchiness into a lot of my recipes -- throw in some sunflower seeds. 
And you can almost trick yourself into thinking you're eating Doritos. 
(Laughter) And it has made me a healthier person. 
So that is it. 
The book about it comes out in April. 
It's called "Drop Dead Healthy." 
And I hope that I don't get sick during the book tour. 
That's my greatest hope. 
So thank you very much. 
(Applause) 

Do you know how many choices you make in a typical day? 
Do you know how many choices you make in typical week? 
I recently did a survey with over 2,000 Americans, and the average number of choices that the typical American reports making is about 70 in a typical day. 
There was also recently a study done with CEOs in which they followed CEOs around for a whole week. 
And these scientists simply documented all the various tasks that these CEOs engaged in and how much time they spent engaging in making decisions related to these tasks. 
And they found that the average CEO engaged in about 139 tasks in a week. 
Each task was made up of many, many, many sub-choices of course. 
50 percent of their decisions were made in nine minutes or less. 
Only about 12 percent of the decisions did they make an hour or more of their time. 
Think about your own choices. 
Do you know how many choices make it into your nine minute category versus your one hour category? 
How well do you think you're doing at managing those choices? 
Today I want to talk about one of the biggest modern day choosing problems that we have, which is the choice overload problem. 
I want to talk about the problem and some potential solutions. 
Now as I talk about this problem, I'm going to have some questions for you and I'm going to want to know your answers. 
So when I ask you a question, since I'm blind, only raise your hand if you want to burn off some calories. 
(Laughter) Otherwise, when I ask you a question, and if your answer is yes, I'd like you to clap your hands. 
So for my first question for you today: Are you guys ready to hear about the choice overload problem? 
(Applause) Thank you. 
So when I was a graduate student at Stanford University, I used to go to this very, very upscale grocery store; at least at that time it was truly upscale. 
It was a store called Draeger's. 
Now this store, it was almost like going to an amusement park. 
They had 250 different kinds of mustards and vinegars and over 500 different kinds of fruits and vegetables and more than two dozen different kinds of bottled water -- and this was during a time when we actually used to drink tap water. 
I used to love going to this store, but on one occasion I asked myself, well how come you never buy anything? 
Here's their olive oil aisle. 
They had over 75 different kinds of olive oil, including those that were in a locked case that came from thousand-year-old olive trees. 
So I one day decided to pay a visit to the manager, and I asked the manager, "Is this model of offering people all this choice really working?" 
And he pointed to the busloads of tourists that would show up everyday, with cameras ready usually. 
We decided to do a little experiment, and we picked jam for our experiment. 
Here's their jam aisle. 
They had 348 different kinds of jam. 
We set up a little tasting booth right near the entrance of the store. 
We there put out six different flavors of jam or 24 different flavors of jam, and we looked at two things: First, in which case were people more likely to stop, sample some jam? 
More people stopped when there were 24, about 60 percent, than when there were six, about 40 percent. 
The next thing we looked at is in which case were people more likely to buy a jar of jam. 
Now we see the opposite effect. 
Of the people who stopped when there were 24, only three percent of them actually bought a jar of jam. 
Of the people who stopped when there were six, well now we saw that 30 percent of them actually bought a jar of jam. 
Now if you do the math, people were at least six times more likely to buy a jar of jam if they encountered six than if they encountered 24. 
Now choosing not to buy a jar of jam is probably good for us -- at least it's good for our waistlines -- but it turns out that this choice overload problem affects us even in very consequential decisions. 
We choose not to choose, even when it goes against our best self-interests. 
So now for the topic of today: financial savings. 
Now I'm going to describe to you a study I did with Gur Huberman, Emir Kamenica, Wei Jang where we looked at the retirement savings decisions of nearly a million Americans from about 650 plans all in the U.S. 
And what we looked at was whether the number of fund offerings available in a retirement savings plan, the 401(k) plan, does that affect people's likelihood to save more for tomorrow. 
And what we found was that indeed there was a correlation. 
So in these plans, we had about 657 plans that ranged from offering people anywhere from two to 59 different fund offerings. 
And what we found was that, the more funds offered, indeed, there was less participation rate. 
So if you look at the extremes, those plans that offered you two funds, participation rates were around in the mid-70s -- still not as high as we want it to be. 
In those plans that offered nearly 60 funds, participation rates have now dropped to about the 60th percentile. 
Now it turns out that even if you do choose to participate when there are more choices present, even then, it has negative consequences. 
So for those people who did choose to participate, the more choices available, the more likely people were to completely avoid stocks or equity funds. 
The more choices available, the more likely they were to put all their money in pure money market accounts. 
Now neither of these extreme decisions are the kinds of decisions that any of us would recommend for people when you're considering their future financial well-being. 
Well, over the past decade, we have observed three main negative consequences to offering people more and more choices. 
They're more likely to delay choosing -- procrastinate even when it goes against their best self-interest. 
They're more likely to make worse choices -- worse financial choices, medical choices. 
They're more likely to choose things that make them less satisfied, even when they do objectively better. 
The main reason for this is because, we might enjoy gazing at those giant walls of mayonnaises, mustards, vinegars, jams, but we can't actually do the math of comparing and contrasting and actually picking from that stunning display. 
So what I want to propose to you today are four simple techniques -- techniques that we have tested in one way or another in different research venues -- that you can easily apply in your businesses. 
The first: Cut. 
You've heard it said before, but it's never been more true than today, that less is more. 
People are always upset when I say, "Cut." 
They're always worried they're going to lose shelf space. 
But in fact, what we're seeing more and more is that if you are willing to cut, get rid of those extraneous redundant options, well there's an increase in sales, there's a lowering of costs, there is an improvement of the choosing experience. 
When Proctor &amp; Gamble went from 26 different kinds of Head &amp; Shoulders to 15, they saw an increase in sales by 10 percent. 
When the Golden Cat Corporation got rid of their 10 worst-selling cat litter products, they saw an increase in profits by 87 percent -- a function of both increase in sales and lowering of costs. 
You know, the average grocery store today offers you 45,000 products. 
The typical Walmart today offers you 100,000 products. 
But the ninth largest retailer, the ninth biggest retailer in the world today is Aldi, and it offers you only 1,400 products -- one kind of canned tomato sauce. 
Now in the financial savings world, I think one of the best examples that has recently come out on how to best manage the choice offerings has actually been something that David Laibson was heavily involved in designing, which was the program that they have at Harvard. 
Every single Harvard employee is now automatically enrolled in a lifecycle fund. 
For those people who actually want to choose, they're given 20 funds, not 300 or more funds. 
You know, often, people say, "I don't know how to cut. 
They're all important choices." 
And the first thing I do is I ask the employees, "Tell me how these choices are different from one another. 
And if your employees can't tell them apart, neither can your consumers." 
Now before we started our session this afternoon, I had a chat with Gary. 
And Gary said that he would be willing to offer people in this audience an all-expenses-paid free vacation to the most beautiful road in the world. 
Here's a description of the road. 
And I'd like you to read it. 
And now I'll give you a few seconds to read it and then I want you to clap your hands if you're ready to take Gary up on his offer. 
(Light clapping) Okay. Anybody who's ready to take him up on his offer. 
Is that all? 
All right, let me show you some more about this. 
(Laughter) You guys knew there was a trick, didn't you. 
(Honk) Now who's ready to go on this trip. 
(Applause) (Laughter) I think I might have actually heard more hands. 
All right. 
Now in fact, you had objectively more information the first time around than the second time around, but I would venture to guess that you felt that it was more real the second time around. 
Because the pictures made it feel more real to you. 
Which brings me to the second technique for handling the choice overload problem, which is concretization. 
That in order for people to understand the differences between the choices, they have to be able to understand the consequences associated with each choice, and that the consequences need to be felt in a vivid sort of way, in a very concrete way. 
Why do people spend an average of 15 to 30 percent more when they use an ATM card or a credit card as opposed to cash? 
Because it doesn't feel like real money. 
And it turns out that making it feel more concrete can actually be a very positive tool to use in getting people to save more. 
So a study that I did with Shlomo Benartzi and Alessandro Previtero, we did a study with people at ING -- employees that are all working at ING -- and now these people were all in a session where they're doing enrollment for their 401(k) plan. 
And during that session, we kept the session exactly the way it used to be, but we added one little thing. 
The one little thing we added was we asked people to just think about all the positive things that would happen in your life if you saved more. 
By doing that simple thing, there was an increase in enrollment by 20 percent and there was an increase in the amount of people willing to save or the amount that they were willing to put down into their savings account by four percent. 
The third technique: Categorization. 
We can handle more categories than we can handle choices. 
So for example, here's a study we did in a magazine aisle. 
It turns out that in Wegmans grocery stores up and down the northeast corridor, the magazine aisles range anywhere from 331 different kinds of magazines all the way up to 664. 
But you know what? 
If I show you 600 magazines and I divide them up into 10 categories, versus I show you 400 magazines and divide them up into 20 categories, you believe that I have given you more choice and a better choosing experience if I gave you the 400 than if I gave you the 600. 
Because the categories tell me how to tell them apart. 
Here are two different jewelry displays. 
One is called "Jazz" and the other one is called "Swing." 
If you think the display on the left is Swing and the display on the right is Jazz, clap your hands. 
(Light Clapping) Okay, there's some. 
If you think the one on the left is Jazz and the one on the right is Swing, clap your hands. 
Okay, a bit more. 
Now it turns out you're right. 
The one on the left is Jazz and the one on the right is Swing, but you know what? 
This is a highly useless categorization scheme. 
(Laughter) The categories need to say something to the chooser, not the choice-maker. 
And you often see that problem when it comes down to those long lists of all these funds. 
Who are they actually supposed to be informing? 
My fourth technique: Condition for complexity. 
It turns out we can actually handle a lot more information than we think we can, we've just got to take it a little easier. 
We have to gradually increase the complexity. 
I'm going to show you one example of what I'm talking about. 
Let's take a very, very complicated decision: buying a car. 
Here's a German car manufacturer that gives you the opportunity to completely custom make your car. 
You've got to make 60 different decisions, completely make up your car. 
Now these decisions vary in the number of choices that they offer per decision. 
Car colors, exterior car colors -- I've got 56 choices. 
Engines, gearshift -- four choices. 
So now what I'm going to do is I'm going to vary the order in which these decisions appear. 
So half of the customers are going to go from high choice, 56 car colors, to low choice, four gearshifts. 
The other half of the customers are going to go from low choice, four gearshifts, to 56 car colors, high choice. 
What am I going to look at? 
How engaged you are. 
If you keep hitting the default button per decision, that means you're getting overwhelmed, that means I'm losing you. 
What you find is the people who go from high choice to low choice, they're hitting that default button over and over and over again. 
We're losing them. 
They go from low choice to high choice, they're hanging in there. 
It's the same information. It's the same number of choices. 
The only thing that I have done is I have varied the order in which that information is presented. 
If I start you off easy, I learn how to choose. 
Even though choosing gearshift doesn't tell me anything about my preferences for interior decor, it still prepares me for how to choose. 
It also gets me excited about this big product that I'm putting together, so I'm more willing to be motivated to be engaged. 
So let me recap. 
I have talked about four techniques for mitigating the problem of choice overload -- cut -- get rid of the extraneous alternatives; concretize -- make it real; categorize -- we can handle more categories, less choices; condition for complexity. 
All of these techniques that I'm describing to you today are designed to help you manage your choices -- better for you, you can use them on yourself, better for the people that you are serving. 
Because I believe that the key to getting the most from choice is to be choosy about choosing. 
And the more we're able to be choosy about choosing the better we will be able to practice the art of choosing. 
Thank you very much. 
(Applause) 

When I was seven years old and my sister was just five years old, we were playing on top of a bunk bed. 
I was two years older than my sister at the time -- I mean, I'm two years older than her now -- but at the time it meant she had to do everything that I wanted to do, and I wanted to play war. 
So we were up on top of our bunk beds. 
And on one side of the bunk bed, I had put out all of my G.I. Joe soldiers and weaponry. 
And on the other side were all my sister's My Little Ponies ready for a cavalry charge. 
There are differing accounts of what actually happened that afternoon, but since my sister is not here with us today, let me tell you the true story -- (Laughter) which is my sister's a little on the clumsy side. 
Somehow, without any help or push from her older brother at all, Amy disappeared off of the top of the bunk bed and landed with this crash on the floor. 
I nervously peered over the side of the bed to see what had befallen my fallen sister and saw that she had landed painfully on her hands and knees on all fours on the ground. 
I was nervous because my parents had charged me with making sure that my sister and I played as safely and as quietly as possible. 
And seeing as how I had accidentally broken Amy's arm just one week before -- (Laughter) (Laughter ends) heroically pushing her out of the way of an oncoming imaginary sniper bullet, (Laughter) for which I have yet to be thanked, I was trying as hard as I could -- she didn't even see it coming -- I was trying hard to be on my best behavior. 
And I saw my sister's face, this wail of pain and suffering and surprise threatening to erupt from her mouth and wake my parents from the long winter's nap for which they had settled. 
So I did the only thing my frantic seven year-old brain could think to do to avert this tragedy. 
And if you have children, you've seen this hundreds of times. 
I said, "Amy, wait. Don't cry. Did you see how you landed? 
No human lands on all fours like that. 
Amy, I think this means you're a unicorn." 
(Laughter) Now, that was cheating, because there was nothing she would want more than not to be Amy the hurt five year-old little sister, but Amy the special unicorn. 
Of course, this option was open to her brain at no point in the past. 
And you could see how my poor, manipulated sister faced conflict, as her little brain attempted to devote resources to feeling the pain and suffering and surprise she just experienced, or contemplating her new-found identity as a unicorn. 
And the latter won. 
Instead of crying or ceasing our play, instead of waking my parents, with all the negative consequences for me, a smile spread across her face and she scrambled back up onto the bunk bed with all the grace of a baby unicorn -- (Laughter) with one broken leg. 
What we stumbled across at this tender age of just five and seven -- we had no idea at the time -- was was going be at the vanguard of a scientific revolution occurring two decades later in the way that we look at the human brain. 
We had stumbled across something called positive psychology, which is the reason I'm here today and the reason that I wake up every morning. 
When I started talking about this research outside of academia, with companies and schools, the first thing they said to never do is to start with a graph. 
The first thing I want to do is start with a graph. 
This graph looks boring, but it is the reason I get excited and wake up every morning. 
And this graph doesn't even mean anything; it's fake data. 
What we found is -- (Laughter) If I got this data studying you, I would be thrilled, because there's a trend there, and that means that I can get published, which is all that really matters. 
There is one weird red dot above the curve, there's one weirdo in the room -- I know who you are, I saw you earlier -- that's no problem. 
That's no problem, as most of you know, because I can just delete that dot. 
I can delete that dot because that's clearly a measurement error. 
And we know that's a measurement error because it's messing up my data. 
(Laughter) So one of the first things we teach people in economics, statistics, business and psychology courses is how, in a statistically valid way, do we eliminate the weirdos. 
How do we eliminate the outliers so we can find the line of best fit? 
Which is fantastic if I'm trying to find out how many Advil the average person should be taking -- two. 
But if I'm interested in your potential, or for happiness or productivity or energy or creativity, we're creating the cult of the average with science. 
If I asked a question like, "How fast can a child learn how to read in a classroom?" 
scientists change the answer to "How fast does the average child learn how to read in that classroom?" 
and we tailor the class towards the average. 
If you fall below the average, then psychologists get thrilled, because that means you're depressed or have a disorder, or hopefully both. 
We're hoping for both because our business model is, if you come into a therapy session with one problem, we want to make sure you leave knowing you have ten, so you keep coming back. 
We'll go back into your childhood if necessary, but eventually we want to make you normal again. 
But normal is merely average. 
And positive psychology posits that if we study what is merely average, we will remain merely average. 
Then instead of deleting those positive outliers, what I intentionally do is come into a population like this one and say, why? 
Why are some of you high above the curve in terms of intellectual, athletic, musical ability, creativity, energy levels, resiliency in the face of challenge, sense of humor? 
Whatever it is, instead of deleting you, what I want to do is study you. 
Because maybe we can glean information, not just how to move people up to the average, but move the entire average up in our companies and schools worldwide. 
The reason this graph is important to me is, on the news, the majority of the information is not positive. 
in fact it's negative. 
And very quickly, my brain starts to think that's the accurate ratio of negative to positive in the world. 
This creates "the medical school syndrome." 
During the first year of medical training, as you read through a list of all the symptoms and diseases, suddenly you realize you have all of them. 
(Laughter) I have a brother in-law named Bobo, which is a whole other story. 
Bobo called me on the phone -- (Laughter) from Yale Medical School, and Bobo said, "Shawn, I have leprosy." 
(Laughter) Which, even at Yale, is extraordinarily rare. 
But I had no idea how to console poor Bobo because he had just gotten over an entire week of menopause. 
(Laughter) We're finding it's not necessarily the reality that shapes us, but the lens through which your brain views the world that shapes your reality. 
And if we can change the lens, not only can we change your happiness, we can change every single educational and business outcome at the same time. 
I applied to Harvard on a dare. 
I didn't expect to get in, and my family had no money for college. 
When I got a military scholarship two weeks later, they let me go. 
Something that wasn't even a possibility became a reality. 
I assumed everyone there would see it as a privilege as well, that they'd be excited to be there. 
Even in a classroom full of people smarter than you, I felt you'd be happy just to be in that classroom. 
But what I found is, while some people experience that, when I graduated after my four years and then spent the next eight years living in the dorms with the students -- Harvard asked me to; I wasn't that guy. 
(Laughter) I was an officer to counsel students through the difficult four years. 
And in my research and my teaching, I found that these students, no matter how happy they were with their original success of getting into the school, two weeks later their brains were focused, not on the privilege of being there, nor on their philosophy or physics, but on the competition, the workload, the hassles, stresses, complaints. 
When I first went in there, I walked into the freshmen dining hall, which is where my friends from Waco, Texas, which is where I grew up -- I know some of you know this. 
When they'd visit, they'd look around, and say, "This dining hall looks like something out of Hogwart's." 
It does, because that was Hogwart's and that's Harvard. 
And when they see this, they say, "Why do you waste your time studying happiness at Harvard? 
What does a Harvard student possibly have to be unhappy about?" 
Embedded within that question is the key to understanding the science of happiness. 
Because what that question assumes is that our external world is predictive of our happiness levels, when in reality, if I know everything about your external world, I can only predict 10% of your long-term happiness. 
90 percent of your long-term happiness is predicted not by the external world, but by the way your brain processes the world. 
And if we change it, if we change our formula for happiness and success, we can change the way that we can then affect reality. 
What we found is that only 25% of job successes are predicted by IQ, 75 percent of job successes are predicted by your optimism levels, your social support and your ability to see stress as a challenge instead of as a threat. 
I talked to a New England boarding school, probably the most prestigious one, and they said, "We already know that. 
So every year, instead of just teaching our students, we have a wellness week. 
And we're so excited. Monday night we have the world's leading expert will speak about adolescent depression. 
Tuesday night it's school violence and bullying. 
Wednesday night is eating disorders. 
Thursday night is illicit drug use. 
And Friday night we're trying to decide between risky sex or happiness." 
(Laughter) I said, "That's most people's Friday nights." 
(Laughter) (Applause) Which I'm glad you liked, but they did not like that at all. 
Silence on the phone. 
And into the silence, I said, "I'd be happy to speak at your school, but that's not a wellness week, that's a sickness week. 
You've outlined all the negative things that can happen, but not talked about the positive." 
The absence of disease is not health. 
Here's how we get to health: We need to reverse the formula for happiness and success. 
In the last three years, I've traveled to 45 countries, working with schools and companies in the midst of an economic downturn. 
And I found that most companies and schools follow a formula for success, which is this: If I work harder, I'll be more successful. 
That undergirds most of our parenting and managing styles, the way that we motivate our behavior. 
And the problem is it's scientifically broken and backwards for two reasons. 
Every time your brain has a success, you just changed the goalpost of what success looked like. 
You got good grades, now you have to get better grades, you got into a good school and after you get into a better one, you got a good job, now you have to get a better job, you hit your sales target, we're going to change it. 
And if happiness is on the opposite side of success, your brain never gets there. 
We've pushed happiness over the cognitive horizon, as a society. 
And that's because we think we have to be successful, then we'll be happier. 
If you can raise somebody's level of positivity in the present, then their brain experiences what we now call a happiness advantage, which is your brain at positive performs significantly better than at negative, neutral or stressed. 
Your intelligence rises, your creativity rises, your energy levels rise. 
In fact, we've found that every single business outcome improves. 
Your brain at positive is 31% more productive than your brain at negative, neutral or stressed. 
Doctors are 19 percent faster, more accurate at coming up with the correct diagnosis when positive instead of negative, neutral or stressed. 
Which means we can reverse the formula. 
If we can find a way of becoming positive in the present, then our brains work even more successfully as we're able to work harder, faster and more intelligently. 
We need to be able to reverse this formula so we can start to see what our brains are actually capable of. 
Because dopamine, which floods into your system when you're positive, has two functions. 
Not only does it make you happier, it turns on all of the learning centers in your brain allowing you to adapt to the world in a different way. 
We've found there are ways that you can train your brain to be able to become more positive. 
In just a two-minute span of time done for 21 days in a row, we can actually rewire your brain, allowing your brain to actually work more optimistically and more successfully. 
We've done these things in research now in every company that I've worked with, getting them to write down three new things that they're grateful for for 21 days in a row, three new things each day. 
And at the end of that, their brain starts to retain a pattern of scanning the world not for the negative, but for the positive first. 
Journaling about one positive experience you've had over the past 24 hours allows your brain to relive it. 
Exercise teaches your brain that your behavior matters. 
We find that meditation allows your brain to get over the cultural ADHD that we've been creating by trying to do multiple tasks at once and allows our brains to focus on the task at hand. 
And finally, random acts of kindness are conscious acts of kindness. 
We get people, when they open up their inbox, to write one positive email praising or thanking somebody in their support network. 
And by doing these activities and by training your brain just like we train our bodies, what we've found is we can reverse the formula for happiness and success, and in doing so, not only create ripples of positivity, but a real revolution. 

I'm going to talk today about saving more, but not today, tomorrow. 
I'm going to talk about Save More Tomorrow. 
It's a program that Richard Thaler from the University of Chicago and I devised maybe 15 years ago. 
The program, in a sense, is an example of behavioral finance on steroids -- how we could really use behavioral finance. 
Now you might ask, what is behavioral finance? 
So let's think about how we manage our money. 
Let's start with mortgages. 
It's kind of a recent topic, at least in the U.S. 
A lot of people buy the biggest house they can afford, and actually slightly bigger than that. 
And then they foreclose. 
And then they blame the banks for being the bad guys who gave them the mortgages. 
Let's also think about how we manage risks -- for example, investing in the stock market. 
Two years ago, three years ago, about four years ago, markets did well. 
We were risk takers, of course. 
Then market stocks seize and we're like, "Wow. 
These losses, they feel, emotionally, they feel very different from what we actually thought about it when markets were going up." 
So we're probably not doing a great job when it comes to risk taking. 
How many of you have iPhones? 
Anyone? Wonderful. 
I would bet many more of you insure your iPhone -- you're implicitly buying insurance by having an extended warranty. 
What if you lose your iPhone? 
What if you do this? 
How many of you have kids? 
Anyone? 
Keep your hands up if you have sufficient life insurance. 
I see a lot of hands coming down. 
I would predict, if you're a representative sample, that many more of you insure your iPhones than your lives, even when you have kids. 
We're not doing that well when it comes to insurance. 
The average American household spends 1,000 dollars a year on lotteries. 
And I know it sounds crazy. 
How many of you spend a thousand dollars a year on lotteries? 
No one. 
So that tells us that the people not in this room are spending more than a thousand to get the average to a thousand. 
Low-income people spend a lot more than a thousand on lotteries. 
So where does it take us? 
We're not doing a great job managing money. 
Behavioral finance is really a combination of psychology and economics, trying to understand the money mistakes people make. 
And I can keep standing here for the 12 minutes and 53 seconds that I have left and make fun of all sorts of ways we manage money, and at the end you're going to ask, "How can we help people?" 
And that's what I really want to focus on today. 
How do we take an understanding of the money mistakes people make, and then turning the behavioral challenges into behavioral solutions? 
And what I'm going to talk about today is Save More Tomorrow. 
I want to address the issue of savings. 
We have on the screen a representative sample of 100 Americans. 
And we're going to look at their saving behavior. 
First thing to notice is, half of them do not even have access to a 401(k) plan. 
They cannot make savings easy. 
They cannot have money go away from their paycheck into a 401(k) plan before they see it, before they can touch it. 
What about the remaining half of the people? 
Some of them elect not to save. 
They're just too lazy. 
They never get around to logging into a complicated website and doing 17 clicks to join the 401(k) plan. 
And then they have to decide how they're going to invest in their 52 choices, and they never heard about what is a money market fund. 
And they get overwhelmed and the just don't join. 
How many people end up saving to a 401(k) plan? 
One third of Americans. 
Two thirds are not saving now. 
Are they saving enough? 
Take out those who say they save too little. 
One out of 10 are saving enough. 
Nine out of 10 either cannot save through their 401(k) plan, decide not to save -- or don't decide -- or save too little. 
We think we have a problem of people saving too much. 
Let's look at that. 
We have one person -- well, actually we're going to slice him in half because it's less than one percent. 
Roughly half a percent of Americans feel that they save too much. 
What are we going to do about it? 
That's what I really want to focus on. 
We have to understand why people are not saving, and then we can hopefully flip the behavioral challenges into behavioral solutions, and then see how powerful it might be. 
So let me divert for a second as we're going to identify the problems, the challenges, the behavioral challenges, that prevent people from saving. 
I'm going to divert and talk about bananas and chocolate. 
Suppose we had another wonderful TED event next week. 
And during the break there would be a snack and you could choose bananas or chocolate. 
How many of you think you would like to have bananas during this hypothetical TED event next week? 
Who would go for bananas? 
Wonderful. 
I predict scientifically 74 percent of you will go for bananas. 
Well that's at least what one wonderful study predicted. 
And then count down the days and see what people ended up eating. 
The same people that imagined themselves eating the bananas ended up eating chocolates a week later. 
Self-control is not a problem in the future. 
It's only a problem now when the chocolate is next to us. 
What does it have to do with time and savings, this issue of immediate gratification? 
Or as some economists call it, present bias. 
We think about saving. We know we should be saving. 
We know we'll do it next year, but today let us go and spend. 
Christmas is coming, we might as well buy a lot of gifts for everyone we know. 
So this issue of present bias causes us to think about saving, but end up spending. 
Let me now talk about another behavioral obstacle to saving having to do with inertia. 
But again, a little diversion to the topic of organ donation. 
Wonderful study comparing different countries. 
We're going to look at two similar countries, Germany and Austria. 
And in Germany, if you would like to donate your organs -- God forbid something really bad happens to you -- when you get your driving license or an I.D., you check the box saying, "I would like to donate my organs." 
Not many people like checking boxes. 
It takes effort. You need to think. 
Twelve percent do. 
Austria, a neighboring country, slightly similar, slightly different. 
What's the difference? 
Well, you still have choice. 
You will decide whether you want to donate your organs or not. 
But when you get your driving license, you check the box if you do not want to donate your organ. 
Nobody checks boxes. 
That's kind of too much effort. 
One percent check the box. The rest do nothing. 
Doing nothing is very common. 
Not many people check boxes. 
What are the implications to saving lives and having organs available? 
In Germany, 12 percent check the box. 
Twelve percent are organ donors. 
Huge shortage of organs, God forbid, if you need one. 
In Austria, again, nobody checks the box. 
Therefore, 99 percent of people are organ donors. 
Inertia, lack of action. 
What is the default setting if people do nothing, if they keep procrastinating, if they don't check the boxes? 
Very powerful. 
We're going to talk about what happens if people are overwhelmed and scared to make their 401(k) choices. 
Are we going to make them automatically join the plan, or are they going to be left out? 
In too many 401(k) plans, if people do nothing, it means they're not saving for retirement, if they don't check the box. 
And checking the box takes effort. 
So we've chatted about a couple of behavioral challenges. 
One more before we flip the challenges into solutions, having to do with monkeys and apples. 
No, no, no, this is a real study and it's got a lot to do with behavioral economics. 
One group of monkeys gets an apple, they're pretty happy. 
The other group gets two apples, one is taken away. 
They still have an apple left. 
They're really mad. 
Why have you taken our apple? 
This is the notion of loss aversion. 
We hate losing stuff, even if it doesn't mean a lot of risk. 
You would hate to go to the ATM, take out 100 dollars and notice that you lost one of those $20 bills. 
It's very painful, even though it doesn't mean anything. 
Those 20 dollars might have been a quick lunch. 
So this notion of loss aversion kicks in when it comes to savings too, because people, mentally and emotionally and intuitively frame savings as a loss because I have to cut my spending. 
So we talked about all sorts of behavioral challenges having to do with savings eventually. 
Whether you think about immediate gratification, and the chocolates versus bananas, it's just painful to save now. 
It's a lot more fun to spend now. 
We talked about inertia and organ donations and checking the box. 
If people have to check a lot of boxes to join a 401(k) plan, they're going to keep procrastinating and not join. 
And last, we talked about loss aversion, and the monkeys and the apples. 
If people frame mentally saving for retirement as a loss, they're not going to be saving for retirement. 
So we've got these challenges, and what Richard Thaler and I were always fascinated by -- take behavioral finance, make it behavioral finance on steroids or behavioral finance 2.0 or behavioral finance in action -- flip the challenges into solutions. 
And we came up with an embarrassingly simple solution called Save More, not today, Tomorrow. 
How is it going to solve the challenges we chatted about? 
If you think about the problem of bananas versus chocolates, we think we're going to eat bananas next week. 
We think we're going to save more next year. 
Save More Tomorrow invites employees to save more maybe next year -- sometime in the future when we can imagine ourselves eating bananas, volunteering more in the community, exercising more and doing all the right things on the planet. 
Now we also talked about checking the box and the difficulty of taking action. 
Save More Tomorrow makes it easy. 
It's an autopilot. 
Once you tell me you would like to save more in the future, let's say every January you're going to be saving more automatically and it's going to go away from your paycheck to the 401(k) plan before you see it, before you touch it, before you get the issue of immediate gratification. 
But what are we going to do about the monkeys and loss aversion? 
Next January comes and people might feel that if they save more, they have to spend less, and that's painful. 
Well, maybe it shouldn't be just January. 
Maybe we should make people save more when they make more money. 
That way, when they make more money, when they get a pay raise, they don't have to cut their spending. 
They take a little bit of the increase in the paycheck home and spend more -- take a little bit of the increase and put it in a 401(k) plan. 
So that is the program, embarrassingly simple, but as we're going to see, extremely powerful. 
We first implemented it, Richard Thaler and I, back in 1998. 
Mid-sized company in the Midwest, blue collar employees struggling to pay their bills repeatedly told us they cannot save more right away. 
Saving more today is not an option. 
We invited them to save three percentage points more every time they get a pay raise. 
And here are the results. 
We're seeing here a three and a half-year period, four pay raises, people who were struggling to save, were saving three percent of their paycheck, three and a half years later saving almost four times as much, almost 14 percent. 
And there's shoes and bicycles and things on this chart because I don't want to just throw numbers in a vacuum. 
I want, really, to think about the fact that saving four times more is a huge difference in terms of the lifestyle that people will be able to afford. 
It's real. 
It's not just numbers on a piece of paper. 
Whereas with saving three percent, people might have to add nice sneakers so they can walk, because they won't be able to afford anything else, when they save 14 percent they might be able to maybe have nice dress shoes to walk to the car to drive. 
This is a real difference. 
By now, about 60 percent of the large companies actually have programs like this in place. 
It's been part of the Pension Protection Act. 
And needless to say that Thaler and I have been blessed to be part of this program and make a difference. 
Let me wrap with two key messages. 
One is behavioral finance is extremely powerful. 
This is just one example. 
Message two is there's still a lot to do. 
This is really the tip of the iceberg. 
If you think about people and mortgages and buying houses and then not being able to pay for it, we need to think about that. 
If you're thinking about people taking too much risk and not understanding how much risk they're taking or taking too little risk, we need to think about that. 
If you think about people spending a thousand dollars a year on lottery tickets, we need to think about that. 
The average actually, the record is in Singapore. 
The average household spends $4,000 a year on lottery tickets. 
We've got a lot to do, a lot to solve, also in the retirement area when it comes to what people do with their money after retirement. 
One last question: How many of you feel comfortable that as you're planning for retirement you have a really solid plan when you're going to retire, when you're going to claim Social Security benefits, what lifestyle to expect, how much to spend every month so you're not going to run out of money? 
How many of you feel you have a solid plan for the future when it comes to post-retirement decisions. 
One, two, three, four. 
Less than three percent of a very sophisticated audience. 
Behavioral finance has a long way. 
There's a lot of opportunities to make it powerful again and again and again. 
Thank you. 
(Applause) 

One of the funny things about owning a brain is that you have no control over the things that it gathers and holds onto, the facts and the stories. 
And as you get older, it only gets worse. 
Things stick around for years sometimes before you understand why you're interested in them, before you understand their import to you. 
Here's three of mine. 
When Richard Feynman was a young boy in Queens, he went for a walk with his dad and his wagon and a ball. 
He noticed that when he pulled the wagon, the ball went to the back of the wagon. 
He asked his dad, "Why does the ball go to the back of the wagon?" 
And his dad said, "That's inertia." 
He said, "What's inertia?" And his dad said, "Ah. 
Inertia is the name that scientists give to the phenomenon of the ball going to the back of the wagon." 
(Laughter) "But in truth, nobody really knows." 
Feynman went on to earn degrees at MIT, Princeton, he solved the Challenger disaster, he ended up winning the Nobel Prize in Physics for his Feynman diagrams, describing the movement of subatomic particles. 
And he credits that conversation with his father as giving him a sense that the simplest questions could carry you out to the edge of human knowledge, and that that's where he wanted to play. 
Eratosthenes was the third librarian at the great Library of Alexandria, and he made many contributions to science. 
But the one he is most remembered for began in a letter that he received as the librarian, from the town of Swenet, which was south of Alexandria. 
The letter included this fact that stuck in Eratosthenes' mind, and the fact was that the writer said, at noon on the solstice, when he looked down this deep well, he could see his reflection at the bottom, and he could also see that his head was blocking the sun. 
I should tell you -- the idea that Christopher Columbus discovered that the world is spherical is total bull. 
It's not true at all. 
In fact, everyone who was educated understood that the world was spherical since Aristotle's time. 
Aristotle had proved it with a simple observation. 
He noticed that every time you saw the Earth's shadow on the Moon, it was circular, and the only shape that constantly creates a circular shadow is a sphere, Q.E.D. the Earth is round. 
But nobody knew how big it was until Eratosthenes got this letter with this fact. 
So he understood that the sun was directly above the city of Swenet, because looking down a well, it was a straight line all the way down the well, right past the guy's head up to the sun. 
Eratosthenes knew another fact. 
He knew that a stick stuck in the ground in Alexandria at the same time and the same day, at noon, the sun's zenith, on the solstice, the sun cast a shadow that showed that it was 7.2 degrees off-axis. 
If you know the circumference of a circle, and you have two points on it, all you need to know is the distance between those two points, and you can extrapolate the circumference. 
360 degrees divided by 7.2 equals 50. 
I know it's a little bit of a round number, and it makes me suspicious of this story too, but it's a good story, so we'll continue with it. 
He needed to know the distance between Swenet and Alexandria, which is good because Eratosthenes was good at geography. 
In fact, he invented the word geography. 
(Laughter) The road between Swenet and Alexandria was a road of commerce, and commerce needed to know how long it took to get there. 
It needed to know the exact distance, so he knew very precisely that the distance between the two cities was 500 miles. 
Multiply that times 50, you get 25,000, which is within one percent of the actual diameter of the Earth. 
He did this 2,200 years ago. 
Now, we live in an age where multi-billion-dollar pieces of machinery are looking for the Higgs boson. 
We're discovering particles that may travel faster than the speed of light, and all of these discoveries are made possible by technology that's been developed in the last few decades. 
But for most of human history, we had to discover these things using our eyes and our ears and our minds. 
Armand Fizeau was an experimental physicist in Paris. 
His specialty was actually refining and confirming other people's results, and this might sound like a bit of an also-ran, but in fact, this is the soul of science, because there is no such thing as a fact that cannot be independently corroborated. 
And he was familiar with Galileo's experiments in trying to determine whether or not light had a speed. 
Galileo had worked out this really wonderful experiment where he and his assistant had a lamp, each one of them was holding a lamp. 
They got the timing down really good. 
They just knew their timing. 
And then they stood at two hilltops, two miles distant, and they did the same thing, on the assumption from Galileo that if light had a discernible speed, he'd notice a delay in the light coming back from his assistant's lamp. 
But light was too fast for Galileo. 
He was off by several orders of magnitude when he assumed that light was roughly ten times as fast as the speed of sound. 
Fizeau was aware of this experiment. 
He lived in Paris, and he set up two experimental stations, roughly 5.5 miles distant, in Paris. 
And he solved this problem of Galileo's, and he did it with a really relatively trivial piece of equipment. 
He did it with one of these. 
I'm going to put away the clicker for a second because I want to engage your brains in this. 
It's got a bunch of notches and it's got a bunch of teeth. 
This was Fizeau's solution to sending discrete pulses of light. 
He put a beam behind one of these notches. 
If I point a beam through this notch at a mirror, five miles away, that beam is bouncing off the mirror and coming back to me through this notch. 
He notices that it seems like a door is starting to close on the light beam that's coming back to his eye. 
Why is that? 
It's because the pulse of light is not coming back through the same notch. 
It's actually hitting a tooth. 
And he spins the wheel fast enough and he fully occludes the light. 
And then, based on the distance between the two stations and the speed of his wheel and the number of notches in the wheel, he calculates the speed of light to within two percent of its actual value. 
And he does this in 1849. 
This is what really gets me going about science. 
Whenever I'm having trouble understanding a concept, I go back and I research the people that discovered that concept. 
I look at the story of how they came to understand it. 
What happens when you look at what the discoverers were thinking about when they made their discoveries, is you understand that they are not so different from us. 
We are all bags of meat and water. We all start with the same tools. 
I love the idea that different branches of science are called fields of study. 
Most people think of science as a closed, black box, when in fact it is an open field. 
And we are all explorers. 
The people that made these discoveries just thought a little bit harder about what they were looking at, and they were a little bit more curious. 
And their curiosity changed the way people thought about the world, and thus it changed the world. 
They changed the world, and so can you. 
Thank you. 
(Applause) 

The recent debate over copyright laws like SOPA in the United States and the ACTA agreement in Europe has been very emotional. 
And I think some dispassionate, quantitative reasoning could really bring a great deal to the debate. 
I'd therefore like to propose that we employ, we enlist, the cutting edge field of copyright math whenever we approach this subject. 
For instance, just recently the Motion Picture Association revealed that our economy loses 58 billion dollars a year to copyright theft. 
Now rather than just argue about this number, a copyright mathematician will analyze it and he'll soon discover that this money could stretch from this auditorium all the way across Ocean Boulevard to the Westin, and then to Mars ... 
(Laughter) ... if we use pennies. 
Now this is obviously a powerful, some might say dangerously powerful, insight. 
But it's also a morally important one. 
Because this isn't just the hypothetical retail value of some pirated movies that we're talking about, but this is actual economic losses. 
This is the equivalent to the entire American corn crop failing along with all of our fruit crops, as well as wheat, tobacco, rice, sorghum -- whatever sorghum is -- losing sorghum. 
But identifying the actual losses to the economy is almost impossible to do unless we use copyright math. 
Now music revenues are down by about eight billion dollars a year since Napster first came on the scene. 
So that's a chunk of what we're looking for. 
But total movie revenues across theaters, home video and pay-per-view are up. 
And TV, satellite and cable revenues are way up. 
Other content markets like book publishing and radio are also up. 
So this small missing chunk here is puzzling. 
(Laughter) (Applause) Since the big content markets have grown in line with historic norms, it's not additional growth that piracy has prevented, but copyright math tells us it must therefore be foregone growth in a market that has no historic norms -- one that didn't exist in the 90's. 
What we're looking at here is the insidious cost of ringtone piracy. 
(Laughter) 50 billion dollars of it a year, which is enough, at 30 seconds a ringtone, that could stretch from here to Neanderthal times. 
(Laughter) It's true. 
(Applause) I have Excel. 
(Laughter) The movie folks also tell us that our economy loses over 370,000 jobs to content theft, which is quite a lot when you consider that, back in '98, the Bureau of Labor Statistics indicated that the motion picture and video industries were employing 270,000 people. 
Other data has the music industry at about 45,000 people. 
And so the job losses that came with the Internet and all that content theft, have therefore left us with negative employment in our content industries. 
And this is just one of the many mind-blowing statistics that copyright mathematicians have to deal with every day. 
And some people think that string theory is tough. 
(Laughter) Now this is a key number from the copyright mathematicians' toolkit. 
It's the precise amount of harm that comes to media companies whenever a single copyrighted song or movie gets pirated. 
Hollywood and Congress derived this number mathematically back when they last sat down to improve copyright damages and made this law. 
Some people think this number's a little bit large, but copyright mathematicians who are media lobby experts are merely surprised that it doesn't get compounded for inflation every year. 
Now when this law first passed, the world's hottest MP3 player could hold just 10 songs. 
And it was a big Christmas hit. 
Because what little hoodlum wouldn't want a million and a half bucks-worth of stolen goods in his pocket. 
(Laughter) (Applause) These days an iPod Classic can hold 40,000 songs, which is to say eight billion dollars-worth of stolen media. 
(Applause) Or about 75,000 jobs. 
(Laughter) (Applause) Now you might find copyright math strange, but that's because it's a field that's best left to experts. 
So that's it for now. 
I hope you'll join me next time when I will be making an equally scientific and fact-based inquiry into the cost of alien music piracy to he American economy. 
Thank you very much. 
(Applause) Thank you. 
(Applause) 

I'd like to invite you to close your eyes. 
Imagine yourself standing outside the front door of your home. 
I'd like you to notice the color of the door, the material that it's made out of. 
Now visualize a pack of overweight nudists on bicycles. 
(Laughter) They are competing in a naked bicycle race, and they are headed straight for your front door. 
I need you to actually see this. 
They are pedaling really hard, they're sweaty, they're bouncing around a lot. 
And they crash straight into the front door of your home. 
Bicycles fly everywhere, wheels roll past you, spokes end up in awkward places. 
Step over the threshold of your door into your foyer, your hallway, whatever's on the other side, and appreciate the quality of the light. 
The light is shining down on Cookie Monster. 
Cookie Monster is waving at you from his perch on top of a tan horse. 
It's a talking horse. 
You can practically feel his blue fur tickling your nose. 
You can smell the oatmeal raisin cookie that he's about to shovel into his mouth. 
Walk past him. 
Walk past him into your living room. 
In your living room, in full imaginative broadband, picture Britney Spears. 
She is scantily clad, she's dancing on your coffee table, and she's singing "Hit Me Baby One More Time." 
And then, follow me into your kitchen. 
In your kitchen, the floor has been paved over with a yellow brick road, and out of your oven are coming towards you Dorothy, the Tin Man, the Scarecrow and the Lion from "The Wizard of Oz," hand-in-hand, skipping straight towards you. 
Okay. Open your eyes. 
I want to tell you about a very bizarre contest that is held every spring in New York City. 
It's called the United States Memory Championship. 
And I had gone to cover this contest a few years back as a science journalist, expecting, I guess, that this was going to be like the Superbowl of savants. 
This was a bunch of guys and a few ladies, widely varying in both age and hygienic upkeep. 
(Laughter) They were memorizing hundreds of random numbers, looking at them just once. 
They were memorizing the names of dozens and dozens and dozens of strangers. 
They were memorizing entire poems in just a few minutes. 
They were competing to see who could memorize the order of a shuffled pack of playing cards the fastest. 
I was like, this is unbelievable. 
These people must be freaks of nature. 
And I started talking to a few of the competitors. 
This is a guy called Ed Cook, who had come over from England, where he had one of the best-trained memories. 
And I said to him, "Ed, when did you realize that you were a savant?" 
And Ed was like, "I'm not a savant. 
In fact, I have just an average memory. 
Everybody who competes in this contest will tell you that they have just an average memory. 
We've all trained ourselves to perform these utterly miraculous feats of memory using a set of ancient techniques, techniques invented 2,500 years ago in Greece, the same techniques that Cicero had used to memorize his speeches, that medieval scholars had used to memorize entire books." 
And I said, "Whoa. How come I never heard of this before?" 
And we were standing outside the competition hall, and Ed, who is a wonderful, brilliant, but somewhat eccentric English guy, says to me, "Josh, you're an American journalist. 
Do you know Britney Spears?" 
I'm like, "What? No. Why?" 
"Because I really want to teach Britney Spears how to memorize the order of a shuffled pack of playing cards on U.S. national television. 
It will prove to the world that anybody can do this." 
(Laughter) I was like, "Well, I'm not Britney Spears, but maybe you could teach me. 
I mean, you've got to start somewhere, right?" 
And that was the beginning of a very strange journey for me. 
I ended up spending the better part of the next year not only training my memory, but also investigating it, trying to understand how it works, why it sometimes doesn't work, and what its potential might be. 
And I met a host of really interesting people. 
This is a guy called E.P. 
He's an amnesic who had, very possibly, the worst memory in the world. 
His memory was so bad, that he didn't even remember he had a memory problem, which is amazing. 
And he was this incredibly tragic figure, but he was a window into the extent to which our memories make us who we are. 
At the other end of the spectrum, I met this guy. 
This is Kim Peek, he was the basis for Dustin Hoffman's character in the movie "Rain Man." 
We spent an afternoon together in the Salt Lake City Public Library memorizing phone books, which was scintillating. 
(Laughter) And I went back and I read a whole host of memory treatises, treatises written 2,000-plus years ago in Latin, in antiquity, and then later, in the Middle Ages. 
And I learned a whole bunch of really interesting stuff. 
One of the really interesting things that I learned is that once upon a time, this idea of having a trained, disciplined, cultivated memory was not nearly so alien as it would seem to us to be today. 
Once upon a time, people invested in their memories, in laboriously furnishing their minds. 
Over the last few millenia, we've invented a series of technologies -- from the alphabet, to the scroll, to the codex, the printing press, photography, the computer, the smartphone -- that have made it progressively easier and easier for us to externalize our memories, for us to essentially outsource this fundamental human capacity. 
These technologies have made our modern world possible, but they've also changed us. 
They've changed us culturally, and I would argue that they've changed us cognitively. 
Having little need to remember anymore, it sometimes seems like we've forgotten how. 
One of the last places on Earth where you still find people passionate about this idea of a trained, disciplined, cultivated memory, is at this totally singular memory contest. 
It's actually not that singular, there are contests held all over the world. 
And I was fascinated, I wanted to know how do these guys do it. 
A few years back a group of researchers at University College London brought a bunch of memory champions into the lab. 
They wanted to know: Do these guys have brains that are somehow structurally, anatomically different from the rest of ours? 
The answer was no. 
Are they smarter than the rest of us? 
They gave them a bunch of cognitive tests, and the answer was: not really. 
There was, however, one really interesting and telling difference between the brains of the memory champions and the control subjects that they were comparing them to. 
When they put these guys in an fMRI machine, scanned their brains while they were memorizing numbers and people's faces and pictures of snowflakes, they found that the memory champions were lighting up different parts of the brain than everyone else. 
Of note, they were using, or they seemed to be using, a part of the brain that's involved in spatial memory and navigation. 
Why? 
The sport of competitive memorizing is driven by a kind of arms race where, every year, somebody comes up with a new way to remember more stuff more quickly, and then the rest of the field has to play catch-up. 
This is my friend Ben Pridmore, three-time world memory champion. 
On his desk in front of him are 36 shuffled packs of playing cards that he is about to try to memorize in one hour, using a technique that he invented and he alone has mastered. 
He used a similar technique to memorize the precise order of 4,140 random binary digits in half an hour. 
(Laughter) Yeah. 
And while there are a whole host of ways of remembering stuff in these competitions, everything, all of the techniques that are being used, ultimately come down to a concept that psychologists refer to as "elaborative encoding." 
And it's well-illustrated by a nifty paradox known as the Baker/baker paradox, which goes like this: If I tell two people to remember the same word, if I say to you, "Remember that there is a guy named Baker." 
That's his name. 
And I say to you, "Remember that there is a guy who is a baker." 
And I come back to you at some point later on, and I say, "Do you remember that word that I told you a while back? 
Do you remember what it was?" 
The person who was told his name is Baker is less likely to remember the same word than the person was told his job is a baker. 
Same word, different amount of remembering; that's weird. 
What's going on here? 
Well, the name Baker doesn't actually mean anything to you. 
It is entirely untethered from all of the other memories floating around in your skull. 
But the common noun "baker" -- we know bakers. 
Bakers wear funny white hats. 
Bakers have flour on their hands. 
Bakers smell good when they come home from work. 
Maybe we even know a baker. 
And when we first hear that word, we start putting these associational hooks into it, that make it easier to fish it back out at some later date. 
The entire art of what is going on in these memory contests, and the entire art of remembering stuff better in everyday life, is figuring out ways to transform capital B Bakers into lower-case B bakers -- to take information that is lacking in context, in significance, in meaning, and transform it in some way, so that it becomes meaningful in the light of all the other things that you have in your mind. 
One of the more elaborate techniques for doing this dates back 2,500 years to Ancient Greece. 
It came to be known as the memory palace. 
The story behind its creation goes like this: There was a poet called Simonides, who was attending a banquet. 
He was actually the hired entertainment, because back then, if you wanted to throw a really slamming party, you didn't hire a D.J., you hired a poet. 
And he stands up, delivers his poem from memory, walks out the door, and at the moment he does, the banquet hall collapses. 
Kills everybody inside. 
It doesn't just kill everybody, it mangles the bodies beyond all recognition. 
Nobody can say who was inside, nobody can say where they were sitting. 
The bodies can't be properly buried. 
It's one tragedy compounding another. 
Simonides, standing outside, the sole survivor amid the wreckage, closes his eyes and has this realization, which is that in his mind's eye, he can see where each of the guests at the banquet had been sitting. 
And he takes the relatives by the hand, and guides them each to their loved ones amid the wreckage. 
What Simonides figured out at that moment, is something that I think we all kind of intuitively know, which is that, as bad as we are at remembering names and phone numbers, and word-for-word instructions from our colleagues, we have really exceptional visual and spatial memories. 
If I asked you to recount the first 10 words of the story that I just told you about Simonides, chances are you would have a tough time with it. 
But, I would wager that if I asked you to recall who is sitting on top of a talking tan horse in your foyer right now, you would be able to see that. 
The idea behind the memory palace is to create this imagined edifice in your mind's eye, and populate it with images of the things that you want to remember -- the crazier, weirder, more bizarre, funnier, raunchier, stinkier the image is, the more unforgettable it's likely to be. 
This is advice that goes back 2,000-plus years to the earliest Latin memory treatises. 
So how does this work? 
Let's say that you've been invited to TED center stage to give a speech, and you want to do it from memory, and you want to do it the way that Cicero would have done it, if he had been invited to TEDxRome 2,000 years ago. 
(Laughter) What you might do is picture yourself at the front door of your house. 
And you'd come up with some sort of crazy, ridiculous, unforgettable image, to remind you that the first thing you want to talk about is this totally bizarre contest. 
(Laughter) And then you'd go inside your house, and you would see an image of Cookie Monster on top of Mister Ed. 
And that would remind you that you would want to then introduce your friend Ed Cook. 
And then you'd see an image of Britney Spears to remind you of this funny anecdote you want to tell. 
And you'd go into your kitchen, and the fourth topic you were going to talk about was this strange journey that you went on for a year, and you'd have some friends to help you remember that. 
This is how Roman orators memorized their speeches -- not word-for-word, which is just going to screw you up, but topic-for-topic. 
In fact, the phrase "topic sentence" -- that comes from the Greek word "topos," which means "place." 
That's a vestige of when people used to think about oratory and rhetoric in these sorts of spatial terms. 
The phrase "in the first place," that's like "in the first place of your memory palace." 
I thought this was just fascinating, and I got really into it. 
And I went to a few more of these memory contests, and I had this notion that I might write something longer about this subculture of competitive memorizers. 
But there was a problem. 
The problem was that a memory contest is a pathologically boring event. 
(Laughter) Truly, it is like a bunch of people sitting around taking the SATs -- I mean, the most dramatic it gets is when somebody starts massaging their temples. 
I know that there's incredible stuff happening in these people's minds, but I don't have access to it. 
And I realized, if I was going to tell this story, I needed to walk in their shoes a little bit. 
And so I started trying to spend 15 or 20 minutes every morning, before I sat down with my New York Times, just trying to remember something. 
Maybe it was a poem, maybe it was names from an old yearbook that I bought at a flea market. 
And I found that this was shockingly fun. 
I never would have expected that. 
It was fun because this is actually not about training your memory. 
What you're doing, is you're trying to get better and better at creating, at dreaming up, these utterly ludicrous, raunchy, hilarious, and hopefully unforgettable images in your mind's eye. 
And I got pretty into it. 
This is me wearing my standard competitive memorizer's training kit. 
(Laughter) It's a pair of earmuffs and a set of safety goggles that have been masked over except for two small pinholes, because distraction is the competitive memorizer's greatest enemy. 
I ended up coming back to that same contest that I had covered a year earlier, and I had this notion that I might enter it, sort of as an experiment in participatory journalism. 
It'd make, I thought, maybe a nice epilogue to all my research. 
Problem was, the experiment went haywire. 
I won the contest -- (Laughter) which really wasn't supposed to happen. 
(Applause) Now, it is nice to be able to memorize speeches and phone numbers and shopping lists, but it's actually kind of beside the point. 
These are just tricks. 
They work because they're based on some pretty basic principles about how our brains work. 
And you don't have to be building memory palaces or memorizing packs of playing cards to benefit from a little bit of insight about how your mind works. 
We often talk about people with great memories as though it were some sort of an innate gift, but that is not the case. 
Great memories are learned. 
At the most basic level, we remember when we pay attention. 
We remember when we are deeply engaged. 
We remember when we are able to take a piece of information and experience, and figure out why it is meaningful to us, why it is significant, why it's colorful, when we're able to transform it in some way that makes sense in the light of all of the other things floating around in our minds, when we're able to transform Bakers into bakers. 
The memory palace, these memory techniques -- they're just shortcuts. 
In fact, they're not even really shortcuts. 
They work because they make you work. 
They force a kind of depth of processing, a kind of mindfulness, that most of us don't normally walk around exercising. 
But there actually are no shortcuts. 
This is how stuff is made memorable. 
And I think if there's one thing that I want to leave you with, it's what E.P., the amnesic who couldn't even remember he had a memory problem, left me with, which is the notion that our lives are the sum of our memories. 
How much are we willing to lose from our already short lives, by losing ourselves in our Blackberries, our iPhones, by not paying attention to the human being across from us who is talking with us, by being so lazy that we're not willing to process deeply? 
I learned firsthand that there are incredible memory capacities latent in all of us. 
But if you want to live a memorable life, you have to be the kind of person who remembers to remember. 
Thank you. 
(Applause) 

(Music) (Applause) (Music) (Applause) (Music) (Applause) (Music) (Applause) 

I have the answer to a question that we've all asked. 
The question is, Why is it that the letter X represents the unknown? 
Now I know we learned that in math class, but now it's everywhere in the culture -- The X prize, the X-Files, Project X, TEDx. 
Where'd that come from? 
About six years ago I decided that I would learn Arabic, which turns out to be a supremely logical language. 
To write a word or a phrase or a sentence in Arabic is like crafting an equation, because every part is extremely precise and carries a lot of information. 
That's one of the reasons so much of what we've come to think of as Western science and mathematics and engineering was really worked out in the first few centuries of the Common Era by the Persians and the Arabs and the Turks. 
This includes the little system in Arabic called al-jebra. 
And al-jebr roughly translates to "the system for reconciling disparate parts." 
Al-jebr finally came into English as algebra. 
One example among many. 
The Arabic texts containing this mathematical wisdom finally made their way to Europe -- which is to say Spain -- in the 11th and 12th centuries. 
And when they arrived there was tremendous interest in translating this wisdom into a European language. 
But there were problems. 
One problem is there are some sounds in Arabic that just don't make it through a European voice box without lots of practice. 
Trust me on that one. 
Also, those very sounds tend not to be represented by the characters that are available in European languages. 
Here's one of the culprits. 
This is the letter sheen, and it makes the sound we think of as SH -- "sh." 
It's also the very first letter of the word shayun, which means "something" just like the the English word "something" -- some undefined, unknown thing. 
Now in Arabic, we can make this definite by adding the definite article "al." 
So this is al-shayun -- the unknown thing. 
And this is a word that appears throughout early mathematics, such as this 10th-century derivation of roots. 
The problem for the Medieval Spanish scholars who were tasked with translating this material is that the letter sheen and the word shayun can't be rendered into Spanish because Spanish doesn't have that SH, that "sh" sound. 
So by convention, they created a rule in which they borrowed the CK sound, "ck" sound, from the classical Greek in the form of the letter Kai. 
Later when this material was translated into a common European language, which is to say Latin, they simply replaced the Greek Kai with the Latin X. 
And once that happened, once this material was in Latin, it formed the basis for mathematics textbooks for almost 600 years. 
But now we have the answer to our question. 
Why is it that X is the unknown? 
X is the unknown because you can't say "sh" in Spanish. 
(Laughter) And I thought that was worth sharing. 
(Applause) 

About 75 years ago, my grandfather, a young man, walked into a tent that was converted into a movie theater like that, and he fell hopelessly in love with the woman he saw on the silver screen: none other than Mae West, the heartthrob of the '30s, and he could never forget her. 
In fact, when he had his daughter many years later, he wanted to name her after Mae West, but can you imagine an Indian child name Mae West? 
The Indian family said, no way! 
So when my twin brother Kaesava was born, he decided to tinker with the spelling of Keshava's name. 
He said, if Mae West can be M-A-E, why can't Keshava be K-A-E? 
So he changed Kaesava's spelling. 
Now Kaesava had a baby boy called Rehan a couple of weeks ago. 
He decided to spell, or, rather, misspell Raehan with an A-E. 
You know, my grandfather died many years ago when I was little, but his love for Mae West lives on as a misspelling in the DNA of his progeny. 
That for me is successful legacy. (Laughs) You know, as for me, my wife and I have our own crazy legacy project. 
We actually sit every few years, argue, disagree, fight, and actually come up with our very own 200-year plan. 
Our friends think we're mad. 
Our parents think we're cuckoo. 
Because, you know, we both come from families that really look up to humility and wisdom, but we both like to live larger than life. 
I believe in the concept of a Raja Yogi: Be a dude before you can become an ascetic. 
This is me being a rock star, even if it's in my own house. 
You know? 
So when Netra and I sat down to make our first plan 10 years ago, we said we want the focus of this plan to go way beyond ourselves. 
What do we mean by beyond ourselves? 
Well 200 years, we calculated, is at the end of our direct contact with the world. 
There's nobody I'll meet in my life will ever live beyond 200 years, so we thought that's a perfect place where we should situate our plan and let our imagination take flight. 
You know, I never really believed in legacy. What am I going to leave behind? I'm an artist. 
Until I made a cartoon about 9/11. 
It caused so much trouble for me. 
I was so upset. 
You know, a cartoon that was meant to be a cartoon of the week ended up staying so much longer. 
Now I'm in the business of creating art that will definitely even outlive me, and I think about what I want to leave behind through those paintings. 
You know, the 9/11 cartoon upset me so much that I decided I'll never cartoon again. 
I said, I'm never going to make any honest public commentary again. 
But of course I continued creating artwork that was honest and raw, because I forgot about how people reacted to my work. 
You know, sometimes forgetting is so important to remain idealistic. 
Perhaps loss of memory is so crucial for our survival as human beings. 
One of the most important things in my 200-year plan that Netra and I write is what to forget about ourselves. 
You know, we carry so much baggage, from our parents, from our society, from so many people -- fears, insecurities -- and our 200-year plan really lists all our childhood problems that we have to expire. 
We actually put an expiry date on all our childhood problems. 
The latest date I put was, I said, I am going to expire my fear of my leftist, feminist mother-in-law, and this today is the date! (Laughs) She's watching. (Laughter) Anyway, you know, I really make decisions all the time about how I want to remember myself, and that's the most important kind of decisions I make. 
And this directly translates into my paintings. 
But like my friends, I can do that really well on Facebook, Pinterest, Twitter, Flickr, YouTube. 
Name it, I'm on it. 
I've started outsourcing my memory to the digital world, you know? But that comes with a problem. 
It's so easy to think of technology as a metaphor for memory, but our brains are not perfect storage devices like technology. 
We only remember what we want to. At least I do. 
And I rather think of our brains as biased curators of our memory, you know? And if technology is not a metaphor for memory, what is it? 
Netra and I use our technology as a tool in our 200-year plan to really curate our digital legacy. 
That is a picture of my mother, and she recently got a Facebook account. 
You know where this is going. 
And I've been very supportive until this picture shows up on my Facebook page. (Laughter) And I actually untagged myself first, then I picked up the phone. I said, "Mom, you will never put a picture of me in a bikini ever again." 
And she said, "Why? You look so cute, darling." I said, "You just don't understand." 
Maybe we are among the first generation that really understands this digital curating of ourselves. 
Maybe we are the first to even actively record our lives. 
You know, whether you agree with, you know, legacy or not, we are actually leaving behind digital traces all the time. 
So Netra and I really wanted to use our 200-year plan to curate this digital legacy, and not only digital legacy but we believe in curating the legacy of my past and future. 
How, you may ask? 
Well, when I think of the future, I never see myself moving forward in time. I actually see time moving backward towards me. 
I can actually visualize my future approaching. 
I can dodge what I don't want and pull in what I want. 
It's like a video game obstacle course. And I've gotten better and better at doing this. Even when I make a painting, I actually imagine I'm behind the painting, it already exists, and someone's looking at it, and I see whether they're feeling it from their gut. 
Are they feeling it from their heart, or is it just a cerebral thing? 
And it really informs my painting. 
Even when I do an art show, I really think about, what should people walk away with? 
I remember when I was 19, I did, I wanted to do my first art exhibition, and I wanted the whole world to know about it. 
I didn't know TED then, but what I did was I closed my eyes tight, and I started dreaming. I could imagine people coming in, dressed up, looking beautiful, my paintings with all the light, and in my visualization I actually saw a very famous actress launching my show, giving credibility to me. 
And I woke up from my visualization and I said, who was that? I couldn't tell if it was Shabana Azmi or Rekha, two very famous Indian actresses, like the Meryl Streeps of India. 
As it turned out, next morning I wrote a letter to both of them, and Shabana Azmi replied, and came and launched my very first show 12 years ago. 
And what a bang it started my career with! You know, when we think of time in this way, we can curate not only the future but also the past. 
This is a picture of my family, and that is Netra, my wife. 
She's the co-creator of my 200-year plan. 
Netra's a high school history teacher. I love Netra, but I hate history. 
I keep saying, "Nets, you live in the past while I'll create the future, and when I'm done, you can study about it." 
(Laughter) She gave me an indulgent smile, and as punishment, she said, "Tomorrow I'm teaching a class on Indian history, and you are sitting in it, and I'm grading you." 
I'm like, "Oh, God." I went. 
I actually went and sat in on her class. She started by giving students primary source documents from India, Pakistan, from Britain, and I said, "Wow." Then she asked them to separate fact from bias. 
I said, "Wow," again. 
Then she said, "Choose your facts and biases and create an image of your own story of dignity." 
History as an imaging tool? 
I was so inspired. 
I went and created my own version of Indian history. 
I actually included stories from my grandmother. 
She used to work for the telephone exchange, and she used to actually overhear conversations between Nehru and Edwina Mountbatten. 
And she used to hear all kinds of things she shouldn't have heard. But, you know, I include things like that. 
This is my version of Indian history. 
You know, if this is so, it occurred to me that maybe, just maybe, the primary objective of our brains is to serve our dignity. 
Go tell Facebook to figure that out! 
Netra and I don't write our 200-year plan for someone else to come and execute it in 150 years. Imagine receiving a parcel saying, from the past, okay now you're supposed to spend the rest of your life doing all of this. No. 
We actually write it only to set our attitudes right. 
You know, I used to believe that education is the most important tool to leave a meaningful legacy. 
Education is great. 
It really teaches us who we are, and helps us contextualize ourselves in the world, but it's really my creativity that's taught me that I can be much more than what my education told me I am. 
I'd like to make the argument that creativity is the most important tool we have. 
It lets us create who we are, and curate what is to come. 
I like to think -- Thank you. 
I like to think of myself as a storyteller, where my past and my future are only stories, my stories, waiting to be told and retold. I hope all of you one day get a chance to share and write your own 200-year story. 
Thank you so much. 
Shukran! (Applause) 

Over the last two decades, India has become a global hub for software development and offshoring of back office services, as we call it, and what we were interested in finding out was that because of this huge industry that has started over the last two decades in India, offshoring software development and back office services, there's been a flight of white collar jobs from the developed world to India. 
When this is combined with the loss of manufacturing jobs to China, it has, you know, led to considerable angst amongst the Western populations. 
In fact, if you look at polls, they show a declining trend for support for free trade in the West. 
Now, the Western elites, however, have said this fear is misplaced. 
For example, if you have read — I suspect many of you have done so — read the book by Thomas Friedman called "The World Is Flat," he said, basically, in his book that, you know, this fear for free trade is wrong because it assumes, it's based on a mistaken assumption that everything that can be invented has been invented. 
In fact, he says, it's innovation that will keep the West ahead of the developing world, with the more sophisticated, innovative tasks being done in the developed world, and the less sophisticated, shall we say, drudge work being done in the developing world. 
Now, what we were trying to understand was, is this true? 
Could India become a source, or a global hub, of innovation, just like it's become a global hub for back office services and software development? 
And for the last four years, my coauthor Phanish Puranam and I spent investigating this topic. 
Initially, or, you know, as people would say, you know, in fact the more aggressive people who are supporting the Western innovative model, say, "Where are the Indian Googles, iPods and Viagras, if the Indians are so bloody smart?" (Laughter) So initially, when we started our research, we went and met several executives, and we asked them, "What do you think? Will India go from being a favored destination for software services and back office services to a destination for innovation?" 
They laughed. They dismissed us. 
They said, "You know what? Indians don't do innovation." 
The more polite ones said, "Well, you know, Indians make good software programmers and accountants, but they can't do the creative stuff." 
Sometimes, it took a more, took a veneer of sophistication, and people said, "You know, it's nothing to do with Indians. 
It's really the rule-based, regimented education system in India that is responsible for killing all creativity." 
They said, instead, if you want to see real creativity, go to Silicon Valley, and look at companies like Google, Microsoft, Intel. 
So we started examining the R&amp;amp;D and innovation labs of Silicon Valley. 
Well, interestingly, what you find there is, usually you are introduced to the head of the innovation lab or the R&amp;amp;D center as they may call it, and more often than not, it's an Indian. (Laughter) So I immediately said, "Well, but you could not have been educated in India, right? 
You must have gotten your education here." 
It turned out, in every single case, they came out of the Indian educational system. 
So we realized that maybe we had the wrong question, and the right question is, really, can Indians based out of India do innovative work? 
So off we went to India. We made, I think, about a dozen trips to Bangalore, Mumbai, Gurgaon, Delhi, Hyderabad, you name it, to examine what is the level of corporate innovation in these cities. 
And what we found was, as we progressed in our research, was, that we were asking really the wrong question. 
When you ask, "Where are the Indian Googles, iPods and Viagras?" you are taking a particular perspective on innovation, which is innovation for end users, visible innovation. 
Instead, innovation, if you remember, some of you may have read the famous economist Schumpeter, he said, "Innovation is novelty in how value is created and distributed." 
It could be new products and services, but it could also be new ways of producing products. 
It could also be novel ways of organizing firms and industries. 
Once you take this, there's no reason to restrict innovation, the beneficiaries of innovation, just to end users. 
When you take this broader conceptualization of innovation, what we found was, India is well represented in innovation, but the innovation that is being done in India is of a form we did not anticipate, and what we did was we called it "invisible innovation." 
And specifically, there are four types of invisible innovation that are coming out of India. 
The first type of invisible innovation out of India is what we call innovation for business customers, which is led by the multinational corporations, which have -- in the last two decades, there have been 750 R&amp;amp;D centers set up in India by multinational companies employing more than 400,000 professionals. 
Now, when you consider the fact that, historically, the R&amp;amp;D center of a multinational company was always in the headquarters, or in the country of origin of that multinational company, to have 750 R&amp;amp;D centers of multinational corporations in India is truly a remarkable figure. 
When we went and talked to the people in those innovation centers and asked them what are they working on, they said, "We are working on global products." 
They were not working on localizing global products for India, which is the usual role of a local R&amp;amp;D. 
They were working on truly global products, and companies like Microsoft, Google, AstraZeneca, General Electric, Philips, have already answered in the affirmative the question that from their Bangalore and Hyderabad R&amp;amp;D centers they are able to produce products and services for the world. 
But of course, as an end user, you don't see that, because you only see the name of the company, not where it was developed. 
The other thing we were told then was, "Yes, but, you know, the kind of work that is coming out of the Indian R&amp;amp;D center cannot be compared to the kind of work that is coming out of the U.S. R&amp;amp;D centers." 
So my coauthor Phanish Puranam, who happens to be one of the smartest people I know, said he's going to do a study. 
What he did was he looked at those companies that had an R&amp;amp;D center in USA and in India, and then he looked at a patent that was filed out of the U.S. and a similar patent filed out of the same company's subsidiary in India, so he's now comparing the patents of R&amp;amp;D centers in the U.S. with R&amp;amp;D centers in India of the same company to find out what is the quality of the patents filed out of the Indian centers and how do they compare with the quality of the patents filed out of the U.S. centers? 
Interestingly, what he finds is — and by the way, the way we look at the quality of a patent is what we call forward citations: How many times does a future patent reference the older patent? — he finds something very interesting. 
What we find is that the data says that the number of forward citations of a patent filed out of a U.S. R&amp;amp;D subsidiary is identical to the number of forward citations of a patent filed by an Indian subsidiary of the same company within that company. 
So within the company, there's no difference in the forward citation rates of their Indian subsidiaries versus their U.S. subsidiaries. 
So that's the first kind of invisible innovation coming out of India. 
The second kind of invisible innovation coming out of India is what we call outsourcing innovation to Indian companies, where many companies today are contracting Indian companies to do a major part of their product development work for their global products which are going to be sold to the entire world. 
For example, in the pharma industry, a lot of the molecules are being developed, but you see a major part of that work is being sent to India. 
For example, XCL Technologies, they developed two of the mission critical systems for the new Boeing 787 Dreamliner, one to avoid collisions in the sky, and another to allow landing in zero visibility. 
But of course, when you climb onto the Boeing 787, you are not going to know that this is invisible innovation out of India. 
The third kind of invisible innovation coming out of India is what we call process innovations, because of an injection of intelligence by Indian firms. 
Process innovation is different from product innovation. 
It's about how do you create a new product or develop a new product or manufacture a new product, but not a new product itself? 
Only in India do millions of young people dream of working in a call center. 
What happens — You know, it's a dead end job in the West, what high school dropouts do. 
What happens when you put hundreds of thousands of smart, young, ambitious kids on a call center job? 
Very quickly, they get bored, and they start innovating, and they start telling the boss how to do this job better, and out of this process innovation comes product innovations, which are then marketed around the world. 
For example, 24/7 Customer, traditional call center company, used to be a traditional call center company. Today they're developing analytical tools to do predictive modeling so that before you pick up the phone, you can guess or predict what this phone call is about. 
It's because of an injection of intelligence into a process which was considered dead for a long time in the West. 
And the last kind of innovation, invisible innovation coming out of India is what we call management innovation. 
It's not a new product or a new process but a new way to organize work, and the most significant management innovation to come out of India, invented by the Indian offshoring industry is what we call the global delivery model. 
What the global delivery model allows is, it allows you to take previously geographically core-located tasks, break them up into parts, send them around the world where the expertise and the cost structure exists, and then specify the means for reintegrating them. 
Without that, you could not have any of the other invisible innovations today. 
So, what I'm trying to say is, what we are finding in our research is, that if products for end users is the visible tip of the innovation iceberg, India is well represented in the invisible, large, submerged portion of the innovation iceberg. 
Now, this has, of course, some implications, and so we developed three implications of this research. 
The first is what we called sinking skill ladder, and now I'm going to go back to where I started my conversation with you, which was about the flight of jobs. 
Now, of course, when we first, as a multinational company, decide to outsource jobs to India in the R&amp;amp;D, what we are going to do is we are going to outsource the bottom rung of the ladder to India, the least sophisticated jobs, just like Tom Friedman would predict. 
Now, what happens is, when you outsource the bottom rung of the ladder to India for innovation and for R&amp;amp;D work, at some stage in the very near future you are going to have to confront a problem, which is where does the next step of the ladder people come from within your company? 
So you have two choices then: Either you bring the people from India into the developed world to take positions in the next step of the ladder — immigration — or you say, there's so many people in the bottom step of the ladder waiting to take the next position in India, why don't we move the next step to India? 
What we are trying to say is that once you outsource the bottom end of the ladder, you -- it's a self-perpetuating act, because of the sinking skill ladder, and the sinking skill ladder is simply the point that you can't be an investment banker without having been an analyst once. 
You can't be a professor without having been a student. 
You can't be a consultant without having been a research associate. 
So, if you outsource the least sophisticated jobs, at some stage, the next step of the ladder has to follow. 
The second thing we bring up is what we call the browning of the TMT, the top management teams. 
If the R&amp;amp;D talent is going to be based out of India and China, and the largest growth markets are going to be based out of India and China, you have to confront the problem that your top management of the future is going to have to come out of India and China, because that's where the product leadership is, that's where the important market leadership is. 
Right? And the last thing we point out in this slide, which is, you know, that to this story, there's one caveat. 
India has the youngest growing population in the world. 
This demographic dividend is incredible, but paradoxically, there's also the mirage of mighty labor pools. 
Indian institutes and educational system, with a few exceptions, are incapable of producing students in the quantity and quality needed to keep this innovation engine going, so companies are finding innovative ways to overcome this, but in the end it does not absolve the government of the responsibility for creating this educational structure. 
So finally, I want to conclude by showing you the profile of one company, IBM. 
As many of you know, IBM has always been considered for the last hundred years to be one of the most innovative companies. 
In fact, if you look at the number of patents filed over history, I think they are in the top or the top two or three companies in the world of all patents filed in the USA as a private company. 
Here is the profile of employees of IBM over the last decade. 
In 2003, they had 300,000 employees, or 330,000 employees, out of which, 135,000 were in America, 9,000 were in India. 
In 2009, they had 400,000 employees, by which time the U.S. employees had moved to 105,000, whereas the Indian employees had gone to 100,000. 
Well, in 2010, they decided they're not going to reveal this data anymore, so I had to make some estimates based on various sources. 
Here are my best guesses. Okay? I'm not saying this is the exact number, it's my best guess. 
It gives you a sense of the trend. 
There are 433,000 people now at IBM, out of which 98,000 are remaining in the U.S., and 150,000 are in India. 
So you tell me, is IBM an American company, or an Indian company? (Laughter) Ladies and gentlemen, thank you very much. (Applause) 

(Music) (Applause) (Applause) (Music) (Applause) (Music) (Applause) Chris Anderson: You guys were amazing. 
That's amazing. 
(Applause) You just don't hear that every day. 
(Laughter) Usman, the official story is that you learned to play the guitar by watching Jimmy Page on YouTube. 
Usman Riaz: Yes, that was the first one. And then I -- That was the first thing I learned, and then I started progressing to other things. 
And I started watching Kaki King a lot, and she would always cite Preston Reed as a big influence, so then I started watching his videos, and it's very surreal right now to be -- (Laughter) (Applause) CA: Was that piece just now, that was one of his songs that you learned, or how did that happen? 
UR: I'd never learned it before, but he told me that we would be playing that on stage, so I was familiar with it, so that's why I had so much more fun learning it. 
And it finally happened, so ... 
(Laughter) CA: Preston, from your point of view, I mean, you invented this like 20 years ago, right? 
How does it feel to see someone like this come along taking your art and doing so much with it? 
Preston Reed: It's mind-blowing, and I feel really proud, really honored. 
And he's a wonderful musician, so it's cool. 
(Laughter) CA: I guess, I don't think there is like a one-minute other piece you guys can do? 
Can you? Do you jam? Do you have anything else? 
PR: We haven't prepared anything. 
CA: There isn't. I'll tell you what. 
If you have another 30 or 40 seconds, and you have another 30 or 40 seconds, and we just see that, I just think -- I can feel it. We want to hear a little more. 
And if it goes horribly wrong, no worries. 
(Applause) (Laughter) (Music) (Applause) 

Frugal Digital is essentially a small research group at C.I.D. 
where we are looking to find alternate visions of how to create a digitally inclusive society. 
That's what we're after. 
And we do this because we actually believe that silicon technology today is mostly about a culture of excess. 
It's about the fastest and the most efficient and the most dazzling gadget you can have, while about two-thirds of the world can hardly reach the most basic of this technology to even address fundamental needs in life, including health care, education and all these kinds of very fundamental issues. 
So before I start, I want to talk about a little anecdote, a little story about a man I met once in Mumbai. 
So this man, his name is Sathi Shri. 
He is an outstanding person, because he's a small entrepreneur. 
He runs a little shop in one of the back streets of Mumbai. 
He has this little 10-square-meter store, where so much is being done. 
It's incredible, because I couldn't believe my eyes when I once just happened to bump into him. 
Basically, what he does is, he has all these services for micro-payments and booking tickets and all kinds of basic things that you would go online for, but he does it for people offline and connects to the digital world. 
More importantly, he makes his money by selling these mobile recharge coupons, you know, for the prepaid subscriptions. 
But then, in the backside, he's got this little nook with a few of his employees where they can fix almost anything. 
Any cell phone, any gadget you can bring them, they can fix it. 
And it's pretty incredible because I took my iPhone there, and he was like, "Yeah, do you want an upgrade?" 
"Yes." (Laughter) I was a bit skeptical, but then, I decided to give him a Nokia instead. (Laughter) But what I was amazed about is this reverse engineering and know-how that's built into this little two meters of space. 
They have figured out everything that's required to dismantle, take things apart, rewrite the circuitry, re-flash the firmware, do whatever you want to with the phone, and they can fix anything so quickly. 
You can hand over a phone this morning and you can go pick it up after lunch, and it was quite incredible. 
But then we were wondering whether this is a local phenomenon, or is truly global? 
And, over time, we started understanding and systematically researching what this tinkering ecosystem is about, because that is something that's happening not just in one street corner in Mumbai. 
It's actually happening in all parts of the country. 
It's even happening in Africa, like, for example, in Cape Town we did extensive research on this. 
Even here in Doha I found this little nook where you can get alarm clocks and watches fixed, and it's a lot of tiny little parts. It's not easy. 
You've got to try it on your own to believe it. 
But what fuels this? 
It's this entire ecosystem of low-cost parts and supplies that are produced all over the world, literally, and then redistributed to basically service this industry, and you can even buy salvaged parts. 
Basically, you don't have to necessarily buy brand new things. You have condemned computers that are stripped apart, and you can buy salvaged components and things that you can reassemble in a new configuration. 
But what does this new, sort of, approach give us? 
That's the real question, because this is something that's been there, part of every society that's deprived of enough resources. 
But there's an interesting paradigm. 
There's the traditional crafts, and then there's the technology crafts. 
We call it the technology crafts because these are emerging. 
They're not something that's been established. 
It's not something that's institutionalized. 
It's not taught in universities. 
It's taught [by] word of mouth, and it's an informal education system around this. 
So we said, "What can we get out of this? 
You know, like, what are the key values that we can get out of this?" 
The main thing is a fix-it-locally culture, which is fantastic because it means that your product or your service doesn't have to go through a huge bureaucratic system to get it fixed. 
It also affords us cheap fabrication, which is fantastic, so it means that you can do a lot more with it. 
And then, the most important thing is, it gives us large math for low cost. 
So it means that you can actually embed pretty clever algorithms and lots of other kinds of extendable ideas into really simple devices. 
So, what we call this is a silicon cottage industry. 
It's basically what was the system or the paradigm before the industrial revolution is now re-happening in a whole new way in small digital shops across the planet in most developing countries. 
So, we kind of toyed around with this idea, and we said, "What can we do with this? 
Can we make a little product or a service out of it?" 
So one of the first things we did is this thing called a multimedia platform. We call it a lunch box. 
Basically one of the contexts that we studied was schools in very remote parts of India. 
So there is this amazing concept called the one-teacher school, which is basically a single teacher who is a multitasker who teaches this amazing little social setting. 
It's an informal school, but it's really about holistic education. 
The only thing that they don't have is access to resources. They don't even have a textbook sometimes, and they don't even have a proper curriculum. 
So we said, "What can we do to empower this teacher to do more?" How to access the digital world? 
Instead of being the sole guardian of information, be a facilitator to all this information. 
So we said, "What are the steps required to empower the teacher?" 
How do you make this teacher into a digital gateway, and how do you design an inexpensive multimedia platform that can be constructed locally and serviced locally?" 
So we walked around. 
We went and scavenged the nearby markets, and we tried to understand, "What can we pick up that will make this happen?" 
So the thing that we got was a little mobile phone with a little pico projector that comes for about 60 dollars. 
We went a bought a flashlight with a very big battery, and a bunch of small speakers. 
So essentially, the mobile phone gives us a connected multimedia platform. 
It allows us to get online and allows us to load up files of different formats and play them. 
The flashlight gives us this really intense, bright L.E.D., and six hours worth of rechargeable battery pack, and the lunch box is a nice little package in which you can put everything inside, and a bunch of mini speakers to sort of amplify the sound large enough. 
Believe me, those little classrooms are really noisy. 
They are kids who scream at the top of their voices, and you really have to get above that. 
And we took it back to this little tinkering setup of a mobile phone repair shop, and then the magic happens. 
We dismantle the whole thing, we reassemble it in a new configuration, and we do this hardware mashup, systematically training the guy how to do this. 
Out comes this, a little lunch box -- form factor. 
(Applause) And we systematically field tested, because in the field testing we learned some important lessons, and we went through many iterations. 
One of the key issues was battery consumption and charging. 
Luminosity was an issue, when you have too much bright sunlight outside. 
Often the roofs are broken, so you don't have enough darkness in the classroom to do these things. 
We extended this idea. We tested it many times over, and the next version we came up with was a box that kind of could trickle charge on solar energy, but most importantly connect to a car battery, because a car battery is a ubiquitous source of power in places where there's not enough electricity or erratic electricity. 
And the other key thing that we did was make this box run off a USB key, because we realized that even though there was GPRS and all that on paper, at least, in theory, it was much more efficient to send the data on a little USB key by surface mail. 
It might take a few days to get there, but at least it gets there in high definition and in a reliable quality. 
So we made this box, and we tested it again and again and again, and we're going through multiple iterations to do these things. 
But it's not limited to just education. 
This kind of a technique or metrology can actually be applied to other kinds of areas, and I'm going to tell you one more little story. 
It's about this little device called a medi-meter. 
It's basically a little health care screening tool that we developed. 
In India, there is a context of these amazing people, the health care workers called ASHA workers. 
They are essentially foot soldiers for the health care system who live in the local community and are trained with basic tools and basic concepts of health care, and the main purpose is basically to inform people to basically, how to lead a better life, but also to divert or sort of make recommendations of what kind of health care should they approach? 
They are basically referral services, essentially. 
But the problem with that is that we realized after a bunch of research that they are amazing at referring people to the nearest clinic or the public health care system, but what happens at the public health care system is this: these incredibly long lines and too many people who overload the system simply because there's not enough doctors and facilities for the population that's being referred. 
So everything from a common cold to a serious case of malaria gets almost the same level of attention, and there's no priorities. 
So we said, "Come on, there's got to be a better way of doing this for sure." 
So we said, "What can we do with the ASHA worker that'll allow this ASHA worker to become an interesting filter, but not just a filter, a really well thought through referral system that allows load balancing of the network, and directs patients to different sources of health care based on the severity or the criticalness of those situations?" 
So the real key question was, how do we empower this woman? 
How do we empower her with simple tools that's not diagnostic but more screening in nature so she at least knows how to advise the patients better? 
And that'll make such a huge difference on the system, because the amount of waiting time and the amount of distances that people need to travel, often sometimes seven to 15 kilometers, sometimes by foot, to get a simple health check done, is very, very detrimental in the sense that it really dissuades people from getting access to health care. 
So if there was something that she could do, that would be amazing. 
So what we did was that we converted this device into a medical device. 
I want to demo this actually, because it's a very simple process. 
Bruno, do you want to join us? (Cheers) Come along. (Applause) So, what we're going to do is that we're going to measure a few basic parameters on you, including your pulse rate and the amount of oxygen that's there in your blood. 
So you're going to put your thumb on top of this. 
Bruno Giussani: Like this, works? 
Vinay Venkatraman: Yeah. That's right. BG: Okay. 
VV: So I'm going to start it up. I hope it works. 
(Beeps) It even beeps, because it's an alarm clock, after all. 
So ... (Laughter) So I take it into the start position, and then I press the read button. (Beeps) So it's taking a little reading from you. (Beeps) And then the pointer goes and points to three different options. 
Let's see what happens here. 
(Beeps) Oh Bruno, you can go home, actually. 
BG: Great. Good news. (Applause) VV: So ... (Applause) So the thing about this is that if the pointer, unfortunately, had pointed to the red spot, we would have to rush you to a hospital. 
Luckily, not today. And if it had pointed to the orange or the amber, it basically meant you had to have, sort of, more continuous care from the health care worker. 
So that was a very simple three-step screening process that could basically change the equation of how public health care works in so many different ways. 
BG: Thank you for the good news. VV: Yeah. 
(Applause) So, very briefly, I'll just explain to you how this is done, because that's the more interesting part. 
So essentially, the three things that are required to make this conversion from this guy to this guy is a cheap remote control for a television that you can almost find in every home today, some parts from a computer mouse, basically, something that you can scavenge for very low cost, and a few parts that have to be pre-programmed. 
Basically this is a micro-controller with a few extra components that can be shipped for very little cost across the world, and that's what is all required with a little bit of local tinkering talent to convert the device into something else. 
So we are right now doing some systematic field tests to basically ascertain whether something like this actually makes sense to the ASHA worker. 
We are going through some reference tests to compare it against professional equipment to see if there's a degree of change in efficacy and if it actually makes an impact in people's lives. But most importantly, what we are trying to do right now is we are trying to scale this up, because there are over 250,000 ASHA workers on the ground who are these amazing foot soldiers, and if we can give at least a fraction of them the access to these things, it just changes the way the economics of public health care works, and it changes the way systems actually function, not just on a systematic planning level, but also in a very grassroots, bottom-up level. 
So that's it, and we hope to do this in a big way. 
Thank you. (Applause) (Applause) 

Everything is interconnected. 
As a Shinnecock Indian, I was raised to know this. 
We are a small fishing tribe situated on the southeastern tip of Long Island near the town of Southampton in New York. 
When I was a little girl, my grandfather took me to sit outside in the sun on a hot summer day. 
There were no clouds in the sky. 
And after a while I began to perspire. 
And he pointed up to the sky, and he said, "Look, do you see that? 
That's part of you up there. 
That's your water that helps to make the cloud that becomes the rain that feeds the plants that feeds the animals." 
In my continued exploration of subjects in nature that have the ability to illustrate the interconnection of all life, I started storm chasing in 2008 after my daughter said, "Mom, you should do that." 
And so three days later, driving very fast, I found myself stalking a single type of giant cloud called the super cell, capable of producing grapefruit-size hail and spectacular tornadoes, although only two percent actually do. 
These clouds can grow so big, up to 50 miles wide and reach up to 65,000 feet into the atmosphere. 
They can grow so big, blocking all daylight, making it very dark and ominous standing under them. 
Storm chasing is a very tactile experience. 
There's a warm, moist wind blowing at your back and the smell of the earth, the wheat, the grass, the charged particles. 
And then there are the colors in the clouds of hail forming, the greens and the turquoise blues. 
I've learned to respect the lightning. 
My hair used to be straight. 
(Laughter) I'm just kidding. 
(Laughter) What really excites me about these storms is their movement, the way they swirl and spin and undulate, with their lava lamp-like mammatus clouds. 
They become lovely monsters. 
When I'm photographing them, I cannot help but remember my grandfather's lesson. 
As I stand under them, I see not just a cloud, but understand that what I have the privilege to witness is the same forces, the same process in a small-scale version that helped to create our galaxy, our solar system, our sun and even this very planet. 
All my relations. Thank you. 
(Applause) 

I'll never forget that day back in the spring of 2006. 
I was a surgical resident at The Johns Hopkins Hospital, taking emergency call. 
I got paged by the E.R. around 2 in the morning to come and see a woman with a diabetic ulcer on her foot. 
I can still remember sort of that smell of rotting flesh as I pulled the curtain back to see her. 
And everybody there agreed this woman was very sick and she needed to be in the hospital. 
That wasn't being asked. 
The question that was being asked of me was a different one, which was, did she also need an amputation? 
Now, looking back on that night, I'd love so desperately to believe that I treated that woman on that night with the same empathy and compassion I'd shown the 27-year-old newlywed who came to the E.R. three nights earlier with lower back pain that turned out to be advanced pancreatic cancer. 
In her case, I knew there was nothing I could do that was actually going to save her life. 
The cancer was too advanced. 
But I was committed to making sure that I could do anything possible to make her stay more comfortable. I brought her a warm blanket and a cup of a coffee. 
I brought some for her parents. 
But more importantly, see, I passed no judgment on her, because obviously she had done nothing to bring this on herself. 
So why was it that, just a few nights later, as I stood in that same E.R. and determined that my diabetic patient did indeed need an amputation, why did I hold her in such bitter contempt? 
You see, unlike the woman the night before, this woman had type 2 diabetes. 
She was fat. 
And we all know that's from eating too much and not exercising enough, right? 
I mean, how hard can it be? 
As I looked down at her in the bed, I thought to myself, if you just tried caring even a little bit, you wouldn't be in this situation at this moment with some doctor you've never met about to amputate your foot. 
Why did I feel justified in judging her? 
I'd like to say I don't know. 
But I actually do. 
You see, in the hubris of my youth, I thought I had her all figured out. 
She ate too much. She got unlucky. 
She got diabetes. Case closed. 
Ironically, at that time in my life, I was also doing cancer research, immune-based therapies for melanoma, to be specific, and in that world I was actually taught to question everything, to challenge all assumptions and hold them to the highest possible scientific standards. 
Yet when it came to a disease like diabetes that kills Americans eight times more frequently than melanoma, I never once questioned the conventional wisdom. 
I actually just assumed the pathologic sequence of events was settled science. 
Three years later, I found out how wrong I was. 
But this time, I was the patient. 
Despite exercising three or four hours every single day, and following the food pyramid to the letter, I'd gained a lot of weight and developed something called metabolic syndrome. 
Some of you may have heard of this. 
I had become insulin-resistant. 
You can think of insulin as this master hormone that controls what our body does with the foods we eat, whether we burn it or store it. 
This is called fuel partitioning in the lingo. 
Now failure to produce enough insulin is incompatible with life. 
And insulin resistance, as its name suggests, is when your cells get increasingly resistant to the effect of insulin trying to do its job. 
Once you're insulin-resistant, you're on your way to getting diabetes, which is what happens when your pancreas can't keep up with the resistance and make enough insulin. 
Now your blood sugar levels start to rise, and an entire cascade of pathologic events sort of spirals out of control that can lead to heart disease, cancer, even Alzheimer's disease, and amputations, just like that woman a few years earlier. 
With that scare, I got busy changing my diet radically, adding and subtracting things most of you would find almost assuredly shocking. 
I did this and lost 40 pounds, weirdly while exercising less. 
I, as you can see, I guess I'm not overweight anymore. 
More importantly, I don't have insulin resistance. 
But most important, I was left with these three burning questions that wouldn't go away: How did this happen to me if I was supposedly doing everything right? 
If the conventional wisdom about nutrition had failed me, was it possible it was failing someone else? 
And underlying these questions, I became almost maniacally obsessed in trying to understand the real relationship between obesity and insulin resistance. 
Now, most researchers believe obesity is the cause of insulin resistance. 
Logically, then, if you want to treat insulin resistance, you get people to lose weight, right? 
You treat the obesity. 
But what if we have it backwards? 
What if obesity isn't the cause of insulin resistance at all? 
In fact, what if it's a symptom of a much deeper problem, the tip of a proverbial iceberg? 
I know it sounds crazy because we're obviously in the midst of an obesity epidemic, but hear me out. 
What if obesity is a coping mechanism for a far more sinister problem going on underneath the cell? 
I'm not suggesting that obesity is benign, but what I am suggesting is it may be the lesser of two metabolic evils. 
You can think of insulin resistance as the reduced capacity of our cells to partition fuel, as I alluded to a moment ago, taking those calories that we take in and burning some appropriately and storing some appropriately. 
When we become insulin-resistant, the homeostasis in that balance deviates from this state. 
So now, when insulin says to a cell, I want you to burn more energy than the cell considers safe, the cell, in effect, says, "No thanks, I'd actually rather store this energy." 
And because fat cells are actually missing most of the complex cellular machinery found in other cells, it's probably the safest place to store it. 
So for many of us, about 75 million Americans, the appropriate response to insulin resistance may actually be to store it as fat, not the reverse, getting insulin resistance in response to getting fat. 
This is a really subtle distinction, but the implication could be profound. 
Consider the following analogy: Think of the bruise you get on your shin when you inadvertently bang your leg into the coffee table. 
Sure, the bruise hurts like hell, and you almost certainly don't like the discolored look, but we all know the bruise per Se is not the problem. 
In fact, it's the opposite. It's a healthy response to the trauma, all of those immune cells rushing to the site of the injury to salvage cellular debris and prevent the spread of infection to elsewhere in the body. 
Now, imagine we thought bruises were the problem, and we evolved a giant medical establishment and a culture around treating bruises: masking creams, painkillers, you name it, all the while ignoring the fact that people are still banging their shins into coffee tables. 
How much better would we be if we treated the cause -- telling people to pay attention when they walk through the living room -- rather than the effect? 
Getting the cause and the effect right makes all the difference in the world. 
Getting it wrong, and the pharmaceutical industry can still do very well for its shareholders but nothing improves for the people with bruised shins. 
Cause and effect. 
So what I'm suggesting is maybe we have the cause and effect wrong on obesity and insulin resistance. 
Maybe we should be asking ourselves, is it possible that insulin resistance causes weight gain and the diseases associated with obesity, at least in most people? 
What if being obese is just a metabolic response to something much more threatening, an underlying epidemic, the one we ought to be worried about? 
Let's look at some suggestive facts. 
We know that 30 million obese Americans in the United States don't have insulin resistance. 
And by the way, they don't appear to be at any greater risk of disease than lean people. 
Conversely, we know that six million lean people in the United States are insulin-resistant, and by the way, they appear to be at even greater risk for those metabolic diseases I mentioned a moment ago than their obese counterparts. 
Now I don't know why, but it might be because, in their case, their cells haven't actually figured out the right thing to do with that excess energy. 
So if you can be obese and not have insulin resistance, and you can be lean and have it, this suggests that obesity may just be a proxy for what's going on. 
So what if we're fighting the wrong war, fighting obesity rather than insulin resistance? 
Even worse, what if blaming the obese means we're blaming the victims? 
What if some of our fundamental ideas about obesity are just wrong? 
Personally, I can't afford the luxury of arrogance anymore, let alone the luxury of certainty. 
I have my own ideas about what could be at the heart of this, but I'm wide open to others. 
Now, my hypothesis, because everybody always asks me, is this. 
If you ask yourself, what's a cell trying to protect itself from when it becomes insulin resistant, the answer probably isn't too much food. 
It's more likely too much glucose: blood sugar. 
Now, we know that refined grains and starches elevate your blood sugar in the short run, and there's even reason to believe that sugar may lead to insulin resistance directly. 
So if you put these physiological processes to work, I'd hypothesize that it might be our increased intake of refined grains, sugars and starches that's driving this epidemic of obesity and diabetes, but through insulin resistance, you see, and not necessarily through just overeating and under-exercising. 
When I lost my 40 pounds a few years ago, I did it simply by restricting those things, which admittedly suggests I have a bias based on my personal experience. 
But that doesn't mean my bias is wrong, and most important, all of this can be tested scientifically. 
But step one is accepting the possibility that our current beliefs about obesity, diabetes and insulin resistance could be wrong and therefore must be tested. 
I'm betting my career on this. 
Today, I devote all of my time to working on this problem, and I'll go wherever the science takes me. 
I've decided that what I can't and won't do anymore is pretend I have the answers when I don't. 
I've been humbled enough by all I don't know. 
For the past year, I've been fortunate enough to work on this problem with the most amazing team of diabetes and obesity researchers in the country, and the best part is, just like Abraham Lincoln surrounded himself with a team of rivals, we've done the same thing. 
We've recruited a team of scientific rivals, the best and brightest who all have different hypotheses for what's at the heart of this epidemic. 
Some think it's too many calories consumed. 
Others think it's too much dietary fat. 
Others think it's too many refined grains and starches. 
But this team of multi-disciplinary, highly skeptical and exceedingly talented researchers do agree on two things. 
First, this problem is just simply too important to continue ignoring because we think we know the answer. 
And two, if we're willing to be wrong, if we're willing to challenge the conventional wisdom with the best experiments science can offer, we can solve this problem. 
I know it's tempting to want an answer right now, some form of action or policy, some dietary prescription -- eat this, not that — but if we want to get it right, we're going to have to do much more rigorous science before we can write that prescription. 
Briefly, to address this, our research program is focused around three meta-themes, or questions. 
First, how do the various foods we consume impact our metabolism, hormones and enzymes, and through what nuanced molecular mechanisms? 
Second, based on these insights, can people make the necessary changes in their diets in a way that's safe and practical to implement? 
And finally, once we identify what safe and practical changes people can make to their diet, how can we move their behavior in that direction so that it becomes more the default rather than the exception? 
Just because you know what to do doesn't mean you're always going to do it. 
Sometimes we have to put cues around people to make it easier, and believe it or not, that can be studied scientifically. 
I don't know how this journey is going to end, but this much seems clear to me, at least: We can't keep blaming our overweight and diabetic patients like I did. 
Most of them actually want to do the right thing, but they have to know what that is, and it's got to work. 
I dream of a day when our patients can shed their excess pounds and cure themselves of insulin resistance, because as medical professionals, we've shed our excess mental baggage and cured ourselves of new idea resistance sufficiently to go back to our original ideals: open minds, the courage to throw out yesterday's ideas when they don't appear to be working, and the understanding that scientific truth isn't final, but constantly evolving. 
Staying true to that path will be better for our patients and better for science. 
If obesity is nothing more than a proxy for metabolic illness, what good does it do us to punish those with the proxy? 
Sometimes I think back to that night in the E.R. 
seven years ago. 
I wish I could speak with that woman again. 
I'd like to tell her how sorry I am. 
I'd say, as a doctor, I delivered the best clinical care I could, but as a human being, I let you down. 
You didn't need my judgment and my contempt. 
You needed my empathy and compassion, and above all else, you needed a doctor who was willing to consider maybe you didn't let the system down. 
Maybe the system, of which I was a part, was letting you down. 
If you're watching this now, I hope you can forgive me. 
(Applause) 

(Music) (Applause) (Music) (Music ends) (Applause) Robbie Mizzone: Thank you. 
Tommy Mizzone: Thank you very much. 
We're so excited to be here. It's such an honor. 
Like he said, we're three brothers from New Jersey -- you know, the bluegrass capital of the world. 
(Laughter) We discovered bluegrass a few years ago, and we fell in love with it. 
We hope you guys will too. 
This next song is an original we wrote called "Time Lapse," and it will probably live up to its name. 
(Tuning) (Music) (Music ends) (Applause) TM: Thank you very much. 
RM: I'm just going to take a second to introduce the band. 
On guitar is my 15-year-old brother Tommy. 
(Applause) On banjo is 10-year-old Jonny. 
(Applause) He's also our brother. 
And I'm Robbie, and I'm 14, and I play the fiddle. 
(Applause) As you can see, we decided to make it hard on ourselves, and we chose to play three songs in three different keys. 
(Tuning) Yeah. I'm also going to explain, a lot of people want to know where we got the name "Sleepy Man Banjo Boys" from. 
So, it started when Jonny was little, and he first started the banjo, he would play on his back with his eyes closed, and we'd say it looked like he was sleeping. 
So you can probably piece the rest together. 
TM: We can't really figure out the reason. 
(Music) (Applause) (Music) (Music ends) (Applause) TM: Thank you very much. 
(Cheering) RM: Thank you. 

This is my grandfather. 
And this is my son. 
My grandfather taught me to work with wood when I was a little boy, and he also taught me the idea that if you cut down a tree to turn it into something, honor that tree's life and make it as beautiful as you possibly can. 
My little boy reminded me that for all the technology and all the toys in the world, sometimes just a small block of wood, if you stack it up tall, actually is an incredibly inspiring thing. 
These are my buildings. 
I build all around the world out of our office in Vancouver and New York. 
And we build buildings of different sizes and styles and different materials, depending on where we are. 
But wood is the material that I love the most, and I'm going to tell you the story about wood. 
And part of the reason I love it is that every time people go into my buildings that are wood, I notice they react completely differently. 
I've never seen anybody walk into one of my buildings and hug a steel or a concrete column, but I've actually seen that happen in a wood building. 
I've actually seen how people touch the wood, and I think there's a reason for it. 
Just like snowflakes, no two pieces of wood can ever be the same anywhere on Earth. 
That's a wonderful thing. 
I like to think that wood gives Mother Nature fingerprints in our buildings. 
It's Mother Nature's fingerprints that make our buildings connect us to nature in the built environment. 
Now, I live in Vancouver, near a forest that grows to 33 stories tall. 
Down the coast here in California, the redwood forest grows to 40 stories tall. 
But the buildings that we think about in wood are only four stories tall in most places on Earth. 
Even building codes actually limit the ability for us to build much taller than four stories in many places, and that's true here in the United States. 
Now there are exceptions, but there needs to be some exceptions, and things are going to change, I'm hoping. 
And the reason I think that way is that today half of us live in cities, and that number is going to grow to 75 percent. 
Cities and density mean that our buildings are going to continue to be big, and I think there's a role for wood to play in cities. 
And I feel that way because three billion people in the world today, over the next 20 years, will need a new home. 
That's 40 percent of the world that are going to need a new building built for them in the next 20 years. 
Now, one in three people living in cities today actually live in a slum. 
That's one billion people in the world live in slums. 
A hundred million people in the world are homeless. 
The scale of the challenge for architects and for society to deal with in building is to find a solution to house these people. 
But the challenge is, as we move to cities, cities are built in these two materials, steel and concrete, and they're great materials. 
They're the materials of the last century. 
But they're also materials with very high energy and very high greenhouse gas emissions in their process. 
Steel represents about three percent of man's greenhouse gas emissions, and concrete is over five percent. 
So if you think about that, eight percent of our contribution to greenhouse gases today comes from those two materials alone. 
We don't think about it a lot, and unfortunately, we actually don't even think about buildings, I think, as much as we should. 
This is a U.S. statistic about the impact of greenhouse gases. 
Almost half of our greenhouse gases are related to the building industry, and if we look at energy, it's the same story. 
You'll notice that transportation's sort of second down that list, but that's the conversation we mostly hear about. 
And although a lot of that is about energy, it's also so much about carbon. 
The problem I see is that, ultimately, the clash of how we solve that problem of serving those three billion people that need a home, and climate change, are a head-on collision about to happen, or already happening. 
That challenge means that we have to start thinking in new ways, and I think wood is going to be part of that solution, and I'm going to tell you the story of why. 
As an architect, wood is the only material, big material, that I can build with that's already grown by the power of the sun. 
When a tree grows in the forest and gives off oxygen and soaks up carbon dioxide, and it dies and it falls to the forest floor, it gives that carbon dioxide back to the atmosphere or into the ground. 
If it burns in a forest fire, it's going to give that carbon back to the atmosphere as well. 
But if you take that wood and you put it into a building or into a piece of furniture or into that wooden toy, it actually has an amazing capacity to store the carbon and provide us with a sequestration. 
One cubic meter of wood will store one tonne of carbon dioxide. 
Now our two solutions to climate are obviously to reduce our emissions and find storage. 
Wood is the only major material building material I can build with that actually does both those two things. 
So I believe that we have an ethic that the Earth grows our food, and we need to move to an ethic in this century that the Earth should grow our homes. 
Now, how are we going to do that when we're urbanizing at this rate and we think about wood buildings only at four stories? 
We need to reduce the concrete and steel and we need to grow bigger, and what we've been working on is 30-story tall buildings made of wood. 
We've been engineering them with an engineer named Eric Karsh who works with me on it, and we've been doing this new work because there are new wood products out there for us to use, and we call them mass timber panels. 
These are panels made with young trees, small growth trees, small pieces of wood glued together to make panels that are enormous: eight feet wide, 64 feet long, and of various thicknesses. 
The way I describe this best, I've found, is to say that we're all used to two-by-four construction when we think about wood. 
That's what people jump to as a conclusion. 
Two-by-four construction is sort of like the little eight-dot bricks of Lego that we all played with as kids, and you can make all kinds of cool things out of Lego at that size, and out of two-by-fours. 
But do remember when you were a kid, and you kind of sifted through the pile in your basement, and you found that big 24-dot brick of Lego, and you were kind of like, "Cool, this is awesome. I can build something really big, and this is going to be great." 
That's the change. 
Mass timber panels are those 24-dot bricks. 
They're changing the scale of what we can do, and what we've developed is something we call FFTT, which is a Creative Commons solution to building a very flexible system of building with these large panels where we tilt up six stories at a time if we want to. 
This animation shows you how the building goes together in a very simple way, but these buildings are available for architects and engineers now to build on for different cultures in the world, different architectural styles and characters. 
In order for us to build safely, we've engineered these buildings, actually, to work in a Vancouver context, where we're a high seismic zone, even at 30 stories tall. 
Now obviously, every time I bring this up, people even, you know, here at the conference, say, "Are you serious? Thirty stories? How's that going to happen?" 
And there's a lot of really good questions that are asked and important questions that we spent quite a long time working on the answers to as we put together our report and the peer reviewed report. 
I'm just going to focus on a few of them, and let's start with fire, because I think fire is probably the first one that you're all thinking about right now. 
Fair enough. 
And the way I describe it is this. 
If I asked you to take a match and light it and hold up a log and try to get that log to go on fire, it doesn't happen, right? We all know that. 
But to build a fire, you kind of start with small pieces of wood and you work your way up, and eventually you can add the log to the fire, and when you do add the log to the fire, of course, it burns, but it burns slowly. 
Well, mass timber panels, these new products that we're using, are much like the log. 
It's hard to start them on fire, and when they do, they actually burn extraordinarily predictably, and we can use fire science in order to predict and make these buildings as safe as concrete and as safe as steel. 
The next big issue, deforestation. 
Eighteen percent of our contribution to greenhouse gas emissions worldwide is the result of deforestation. 
The last thing we want to do is cut down trees. 
Or, the last thing we want to do is cut down the wrong trees. 
There are models for sustainable forestry that allow us to cut trees properly, and those are the only trees appropriate to use for these kinds of systems. 
Now I actually think that these ideas will change the economics of deforestation. 
In countries with deforestation issues, we need to find a way to provide better value for the forest and actually encourage people to make money through very fast growth cycles -- 10-, 12-, 15-year-old trees that make these products and allow us to build at this scale. 
We've calculated a 20-story building: We'll grow enough wood in North America every 13 minutes. 
That's how much it takes. 
The carbon story here is a really good one. 
If we built a 20-story building out of cement and concrete, the process would result in the manufacturing of that cement and 1,200 tonnes of carbon dioxide. 
If we did it in wood, in this solution, we'd sequester about 3,100 tonnes, for a net difference of 4,300 tonnes. 
That's the equivalent of about 900 cars removed from the road in one year. 
Think back to that three billion people that need a new home, and maybe this is a contributor to reducing. 
We're at the beginning of a revolution, I hope, in the way we build, because this is the first new way to build a skyscraper in probably 100 years or more. 
But the challenge is changing society's perception of possibility, and it's a huge challenge. 
The engineering is, truthfully, the easy part of this. 
And the way I describe it is this. 
The first skyscraper, technically -- and the definition of a skyscraper is 10 stories tall, believe it or not — but the first skyscraper was this one in Chicago, and people were terrified to walk underneath this building. 
But only four years after it was built, Gustave Eiffel was building the Eiffel Tower, and as he built the Eiffel Tower, he changed the skylines of the cities of the world, changed and created a competition between places like New York City and Chicago, where developers started building bigger and bigger buildings and pushing the envelope up higher and higher with better and better engineering. 
We built this model in New York, actually, as a theoretical model on the campus of a technical university soon to come, and the reason we picked this site to just show you what these buildings may look like, because the exterior can change. 
It's really just the structure that we're talking about. 
The reason we picked it is because this is a technical university, and I believe that wood is the most technologically advanced material I can build with. 
It just happens to be that Mother Nature holds the patent, and we don't really feel comfortable with it. 
But that's the way it should be, nature's fingerprints in the built environment. 
I'm looking for this opportunity to create an Eiffel Tower moment, we call it. 
Buildings are starting to go up around the world. 
There's a building in London that's nine stories, a new building that just finished in Australia that I believe is 10 or 11. 
We're starting to push the height up of these wood buildings, and we're hoping, and I'm hoping, that my hometown of Vancouver actually potentially announces the world's tallest at around 20 stories in the not-so-distant future. 
That Eiffel Tower moment will break the ceiling, these arbitrary ceilings of height, and allow wood buildings to join the competition. 
And I believe the race is ultimately on. 
Thank you. 
(Applause) 

(Applause) (Music) (Applause) 

So why do we learn mathematics? 
Essentially, for three reasons: calculation, application, and last, and unfortunately least in terms of the time we give it, inspiration. 
Mathematics is the science of patterns, and we study it to learn how to think logically, critically and creatively, but too much of the mathematics that we learn in school is not effectively motivated, and when our students ask, "Why are we learning this?" 
then they often hear that they'll need it in an upcoming math class or on a future test. 
But wouldn't it be great if every once in a while we did mathematics simply because it was fun or beautiful or because it excited the mind? 
Now, I know many people have not had the opportunity to see how this can happen, so let me give you a quick example with my favorite collection of numbers, the Fibonacci numbers. (Applause) Yeah! I already have Fibonacci fans here. 
That's great. 
Now these numbers can be appreciated in many different ways. 
From the standpoint of calculation, they're as easy to understand as one plus one, which is two. 
Then one plus two is three, two plus three is five, three plus five is eight, and so on. 
Indeed, the person we call Fibonacci was actually named Leonardo of Pisa, and these numbers appear in his book "Liber Abaci," which taught the Western world the methods of arithmetic that we use today. 
In terms of applications, Fibonacci numbers appear in nature surprisingly often. 
The number of petals on a flower is typically a Fibonacci number, or the number of spirals on a sunflower or a pineapple tends to be a Fibonacci number as well. 
In fact, there are many more applications of Fibonacci numbers, but what I find most inspirational about them are the beautiful number patterns they display. 
Let me show you one of my favorites. 
Suppose you like to square numbers, and frankly, who doesn't? (Laughter) Let's look at the squares of the first few Fibonacci numbers. 
So one squared is one, two squared is four, three squared is nine, five squared is 25, and so on. 
Now, it's no surprise that when you add consecutive Fibonacci numbers, you get the next Fibonacci number. Right? 
That's how they're created. 
But you wouldn't expect anything special to happen when you add the squares together. 
But check this out. 
One plus one gives us two, and one plus four gives us five. 
And four plus nine is 13, nine plus 25 is 34, and yes, the pattern continues. 
In fact, here's another one. 
Suppose you wanted to look at adding the squares of the first few Fibonacci numbers. 
Let's see what we get there. 
So one plus one plus four is six. 
Add nine to that, we get 15. 
Add 25, we get 40. 
Add 64, we get 104. 
Now look at those numbers. 
Those are not Fibonacci numbers, but if you look at them closely, you'll see the Fibonacci numbers buried inside of them. 
Do you see it? I'll show it to you. 
Six is two times three, 15 is three times five, 40 is five times eight, two, three, five, eight, who do we appreciate? 
(Laughter) Fibonacci! Of course. 
Now, as much fun as it is to discover these patterns, it's even more satisfying to understand why they are true. 
Let's look at that last equation. 
Why should the squares of one, one, two, three, five and eight add up to eight times 13? 
I'll show you by drawing a simple picture. 
We'll start with a one-by-one square and next to that put another one-by-one square. 
Together, they form a one-by-two rectangle. 
Beneath that, I'll put a two-by-two square, and next to that, a three-by-three square, beneath that, a five-by-five square, and then an eight-by-eight square, creating one giant rectangle, right? 
Now let me ask you a simple question: what is the area of the rectangle? 
Well, on the one hand, it's the sum of the areas of the squares inside it, right? 
Just as we created it. 
It's one squared plus one squared plus two squared plus three squared plus five squared plus eight squared. Right? 
That's the area. 
On the other hand, because it's a rectangle, the area is equal to its height times its base, and the height is clearly eight, and the base is five plus eight, which is the next Fibonacci number, 13. Right? 
So the area is also eight times 13. 
Since we've correctly calculated the area two different ways, they have to be the same number, and that's why the squares of one, one, two, three, five and eight add up to eight times 13. 
Now, if we continue this process, we'll generate rectangles of the form 13 by 21, 21 by 34, and so on. 
Now check this out. 
If you divide 13 by eight, you get 1.625. 
And if you divide the larger number by the smaller number, then these ratios get closer and closer to about 1.618, known to many people as the Golden Ratio, a number which has fascinated mathematicians, scientists and artists for centuries. 
Now, I show all this to you because, like so much of mathematics, there's a beautiful side to it that I fear does not get enough attention in our schools. 
We spend lots of time learning about calculation, but let's not forget about application, including, perhaps, the most important application of all, learning how to think. 
If I could summarize this in one sentence, it would be this: Mathematics is not just solving for x, it's also figuring out why. 
Thank you very much. 
(Applause) 

So the first antidepressants were made from, of all things, rocket fuel, left over after World War II. 
Which is fitting, seeing as today, one in five soldiers develop depression, or post-traumatic stress disorder or both. 
But it's not just soldiers that are at high risk for these diseases. 
It's firefighters, ER doctors, cancer patients, aid workers, refugees -- anyone exposed to trauma or major life stress. 
And yet, despite how commonplace these disorders are, our current treatments, if they work at all, only suppress symptoms. 
In 1798, when Edward Jenner discovered the first vaccine -- it happened to be for smallpox -- he didn't just discover a prophylactic for a disease, but a whole new way of thinking: that medicine could prevent disease. 
However, for over 200 years, this prevention was not believed to extend to psychiatric diseases. 
Until 2014, when my colleague and I accidentally discovered the first drugs that might prevent depression and PTSD. 
We discovered the drugs in mice, and we're currently studying whether they work in humans. 
And these preventative psychopharmaceuticals are not antidepressants. 
They are a whole new class of drug. 
And they work by increasing stress resilience, so let's call them resilience enhancers. 
So think back to a stressful time that you've since recovered from. 
Maybe a breakup or an exam, you missed a flight. 
Stress resilience is the active biological process that allows us to bounce back after stress. 
Similar to if you have a cold and your immune system fights it off. 
And insufficient resilience in the face of a significant enough stressor, can result in a psychiatric disorder, such as depression. 
In fact, most cases of major depressive disorder are initially triggered by stress. 
And from what we've seen so far in mice, resilience enhancers can protect against purely biological stressors, like stress hormones, and social and psychological stressors, like bullying and isolation. 
So here is an example where we gave mice three weeks of high levels of stress hormones. 
So, in other words, a biological stressor without a psychological component. 
And this causes depressive behavior. 
And if we give three weeks of antidepressant treatment beforehand, it has no beneficial effects. 
But a single dose of a resilience enhancer given a week before completely prevents the depressive behavior. 
Even after three weeks of stress. 
This is the first time a drug has ever been shown to prevent the negative effects of stress. 
Depression and PTSD are chronic, often lifelong, clinical diseases. 
They also increase the risk of substance abuse, homelessness, heart disease, Alzheimer's, suicide. 
The global cost of depression alone is over three trillion dollars per year. 
But now, imagine a scenario where we know someone is predictively at high risk for exposure to extreme stress. 
Say, a red cross volunteer going into an earthquake zone. 
In addition to the typhoid vaccine, we could give her a pill or an injection of a resilience enhancer before she leaves. 
So when she is held at gunpoint by looters or worse, she would at least be protected against developing depression or PTSD after the fact. 
It won't prevent her from experiencing the stress, but it will allow her to recover from it. 
And that's what's revolutionary here. 
By increasing resiliency, we can dramatically reduce her susceptibility to depression and PTSD, possibly saving her from losing her job, her home, her family or even her life. 
After Jenner discovered the smallpox vaccine, a lot of other vaccines rapidly followed. 
But it was over 150 years before a tuberculosis vaccine was widely available. 
Why? 
In part because society believed that tuberculosis made people more sensitive and creative and empathetic. 
And that it was caused by constitution and not biology. 
And similar things are still said today about depression. 
And just as Jenner's discovery opened the door for all of the vaccines that followed after, the drugs we've discovered open the possibility of a whole new field: preventative psychopharmacology. 
But whether that's 15 years away, or 150 years away, depends not just on the science, but on what we as a society choose to do with it. 
Thank you. 
(Applause) 

The Olympic motto is "Citius, Altius, Fortius." 
Faster, Higher, Stronger. 
And athletes have fulfilled that motto rapidly. 
The winner of the 2012 Olympic marathon ran two hours and eight minutes. 
Had he been racing against the winner of the 1904 Olympic marathon, he would have won by nearly an hour and a half. 
Now we all have this feeling that we're somehow just getting better as a human race, inexorably progressing, but it's not like we've evolved into a new species in a century. 
So what's going on here? 
I want to take a look at what's really behind this march of athletic progress. 
In 1936, Jesse Owens held the world record in the 100 meters. 
Had Jesse Owens been racing last year in the world championships of the 100 meters, when Jamaican sprinter Usain Bolt finished, Owens would have still had 14 feet to go. 
That's a lot in sprinter land. 
To give you a sense of how much it is, I want to share with you a demonstration conceived by sports scientist Ross Tucker. 
Now picture the stadium last year at the world championships of the 100 meters: thousands of fans waiting with baited breath to see Usain Bolt, the fastest man in history; flashbulbs popping as the nine fastest men in the world coil themselves into their blocks. 
And I want you to pretend that Jesse Owens is in that race. 
Now close your eyes for a second and picture the race. 
Bang! The gun goes off. 
An American sprinter jumps out to the front. 
Usain Bolt starts to catch him. 
Usain Bolt passes him, and as the runners come to the finish, you'll hear a beep as each man crosses the line. 
(Beeps) That's the entire finish of the race. 
You can open your eyes now. 
That first beep was Usain Bolt. 
That last beep was Jesse Owens. 
Listen to it again. 
(Beeps) When you think of it like that, it's not that big a difference, is it? 
And then consider that Usain Bolt started by propelling himself out of blocks down a specially fabricated carpet designed to allow him to travel as fast as humanly possible. 
Jesse Owens, on the other hand, ran on cinders, the ash from burnt wood, and that soft surface stole far more energy from his legs as he ran. 
Rather than blocks, Jesse Owens had a gardening trowel that he had to use to dig holes in the cinders to start from. 
Biomechanical analysis of the speed of Owens' joints shows that had been running on the same surface as Bolt, he wouldn't have been 14 feet behind, he would have been within one stride. 
Rather than the last beep, Owens would have been the second beep. 
Listen to it again. 
(Beeps) That's the difference track surface technology has made, and it's done it throughout the running world. 
Consider a longer event. 
In 1954, Sir Roger Bannister became the first man to run under four minutes in the mile. 
Nowadays, college kids do that every year. 
On rare occasions, a high school kid does it. 
As of the end of last year, 1,314 men had run under four minutes in the mile, but like Jesse Owens, Sir Roger Bannister ran on soft cinders that stole far more energy from his legs than the synthetic tracks of today. 
So I consulted biomechanics experts to find out how much slower it is to run on cinders than synthetic tracks, and their consensus that it's one and a half percent slower. 
So if you apply a one and a half percent slowdown conversion to every man who ran his sub-four mile on a synthetic track, this is what happens. 
Only 530 are left. 
If you look at it from that perspective, fewer than ten new men per [year] have joined the sub-four mile club since Sir Roger Bannister. 
Now, 530 is a lot more than one, and that's partly because there are many more people training today and they're training more intelligently. 
Even college kids are professional in their training compared to Sir Roger Bannister, who trained for 45 minutes at a time while he ditched gynecology lectures in med school. 
And that guy who won the 1904 Olympic marathon in three in a half hours, that guy was drinking rat poison and brandy while he ran along the course. 
That was his idea of a performance-enhancing drug. 
(Laughter) Clearly, athletes have gotten more savvy about performance-enhancing drugs as well, and that's made a difference in some sports at some times, but technology has made a difference in all sports, from faster skis to lighter shoes. 
Take a look at the record for the 100-meter freestyle swim. 
The record is always trending downward, but it's punctuated by these steep cliffs. 
This first cliff, in 1956, is the introduction of the flip turn. 
Rather than stopping and turning around, athletes could somersault under the water and get going right away in the opposite direction. 
This second cliff, the introduction of gutters on the side of the pool that allows water to splash off, rather than becoming turbulence that impedes the swimmers as they race. 
This final cliff, the introduction of full-body and low-friction swimsuits. 
Throughout sports, technology has changed the face of performance. 
In 1972, Eddy Merckx set the record for the longest distance cycled in one hour at 30 miles, 3,774 feet. 
Now that record improved and improved as bicycles improved and became more aerodynamic all the way until 1996, when it was set at 35 miles, 1,531 feet, nearly five miles farther than Eddy Merckx cycled in 1972. 
But then in 2000, the International Cycling Union decreed that anyone who wanted to hold that record had to do so with essentially the same equipment that Eddy Merckx used in 1972. 
Where does the record stand today? 
30 miles, 4,657 feet, a grand total of 883 feet farther than Eddy Merckx cycled more than four decades ago. 
Essentially the entire improvement in this record was due to technology. 
Still, technology isn't the only thing pushing athletes forward. 
While indeed we haven't evolved into a new species in a century, the gene pool within competitive sports most certainly has changed. 
In the early half of the 20th century, physical education instructors and coaches had the idea that the average body type was the best for all athletic endeavors: medium height, medium weight, no matter the sport. 
And this showed in athletes' bodies. 
In the 1920s, the average elite high-jumper and average elite shot-putter were the same exact size. 
But as that idea started to fade away, as sports scientists and coaches realized that rather than the average body type, you want highly specialized bodies that fit into certain athletic niches, a form of artificial selection took place, a self-sorting for bodies that fit certain sports, and athletes' bodies became more different from one another. 
Today, rather than the same size as the average elite high jumper, the average elite shot-putter is two and a half inches taller and 130 pounds heavier. 
And this happened throughout the sports world. 
In fact, if you plot on a height versus mass graph one data point for each of two dozen sports in the first half of the 20th century, it looks like this. 
There's some dispersal, but it's kind of grouped around that average body type. 
Then that idea started to go away, and at the same time, digital technology -- first radio, then television and the Internet -- gave millions, or in some cases billions, of people a ticket to consume elite sports performance. 
The financial incentives and fame and glory afforded elite athletes skyrocketed, and it tipped toward the tiny upper echelon of performance. 
It accelerated the artificial selection for specialized bodies. 
And if you plot a data point for these same two dozen sports today, it looks like this. 
The athletes' bodies have gotten much more different from one another. 
And because this chart looks like the charts that show the expanding universe, with the galaxies flying away from one another, the scientists who discovered it call it "The Big Bang of Body Types." 
In sports where height is prized, like basketball, the tall athletes got taller. 
In 1983, the National Basketball Association signed a groundbreaking agreement making players partners in the league, entitled to shares of ticket revenues and television contracts. 
Suddenly, anybody who could be an NBA player wanted to be, and teams started scouring the globe for the bodies that could help them win championships. 
Almost overnight, the proportion of men in the NBA who are at least seven feet tall doubled to 10 percent. 
Today, one in 10 men in the NBA is at least seven feet tall, but a seven-foot-tall man is incredibly rare in the general population -- so rare that if you know an American man between the ages of 20 and 40 who is at least seven feet tall, there's a 17 percent chance he's in the NBA right now. 
(Laughter) That is, find six honest seven footers, one is in the NBA right now. 
And that's not the only way that NBA players' bodies are unique. 
This is Leonardo da Vinci's "Vitruvian Man," the ideal proportions, with arm span equal to height. 
My arm span is exactly equal to my height. 
Yours is probably very nearly so. 
But not the average NBA player. 
The average NBA player is a shade under 6'7", with arms that are seven feet long. 
Not only are NBA players ridiculously tall, they are ludicrously long. 
Had Leonardo wanted to draw the Vitruvian NBA Player, he would have needed a rectangle and an ellipse, not a circle and a square. 
So in sports where large size is prized, the large athletes have gotten larger. 
Conversely, in sports where diminutive stature is an advantage, the small athletes got smaller. 
The average elite female gymnast shrunk from 5'3" to 4'9" on average over the last 30 years, all the better for their power-to-weight ratio and for spinning in the air. 
And while the large got larger and the small got smaller, the weird got weirder. 
The average length of the forearm of a water polo player in relation to their total arm got longer, all the better for a forceful throwing whip. 
And as the large got larger, small got smaller, and the weird weirder. 
In swimming, the ideal body type is a long torso and short legs. 
It's like the long hull of a canoe for speed over the water. 
And the opposite is advantageous in running. 
You want long legs and a short torso. 
And this shows in athletes' bodies today. 
Here you see Michael Phelps, the greatest swimmer in history, standing next to Hicham El Guerrouj, the world record holder in the mile. 
These men are seven inches different in height, but because of the body types advantaged in their sports, they wear the same length pants. 
Seven inches difference in height, these men have the same length legs. 
Now in some cases, the search for bodies that could push athletic performance forward ended up introducing into the competitive world populations of people that weren't previously competing at all, like Kenyan distance runners. 
We think of Kenyans as being great marathoners. 
Kenyans think of the Kalenjin tribe as being great marathoners. 
The Kalenjin make up just 12 percent of the Kenyan population but the vast majority of elite runners. 
And they happen, on average, to have a certain unique physiology: legs that are very long and very thin at their extremity, and this is because they have their ancestry at very low latitude in a very hot and dry climate, and an evolutionary adaptation to that is limbs that are very long and very thin at the extremity for cooling purposes. 
It's the same reason that a radiator has long coils, to increase surface area compared to volume to let heat out, and because the leg is like a pendulum, the longer and thinner it is at the extremity, the more energy-efficient it is to swing. 
To put Kalenjin running success in perspective, consider that 17 American men in history have run faster than two hours and 10 minutes in the marathon. 
That's a four-minute-and-58-second-per-mile pace. 
Thirty-two Kalenjin men did that last October. 
(Laughter) That's from a source population the size of metropolitan Atlanta. 
Still, even changing technology and the changing gene pool in sports don't account for all of the changes in performance. 
Athletes have a different mindset than they once did. 
Have you ever seen in a movie when someone gets an electrical shock and they're thrown across a room? 
There's no explosion there. 
What's happening when that happens is that the electrical impulse is causing all their muscle fibers to twitch at once, and they're throwing themselves across the room. 
They're essentially jumping. 
That's the power that's contained in the human body. 
But normally we can't access nearly all of it. 
Our brain acts as a limiter, preventing us from accessing all of our physical resources, because we might hurt ourselves, tearing tendons or ligaments. 
But the more we learn about how that limiter functions, the more we learn how we can push it back just a bit, in some cases by convincing the brain that the body won't be in mortal danger by pushing harder. 
Endurance and ultra-endurance sports serve as a great example. 
Ultra-endurance was once thought to be harmful to human health, but now we realize that we have all these traits that are perfect for ultra-endurance: no body fur and a glut of sweat glands that keep us cool while running; narrow waists and long legs compared to our frames; large surface area of joints for shock absorption. 
We have an arch in our foot that acts like a spring, short toes that are better for pushing off than for grasping tree limbs, and when we run, we can turn our torso and our shoulders like this while keeping our heads straight. 
Our primate cousins can't do that. 
They have to run like this. 
And we have big old butt muscles that keep us upright while running. 
Have you ever looked at an ape's butt? 
They have no buns because they don't run upright. 
And as athletes have realized that we're perfectly suited for ultra-endurance, they've taken on feats that would have been unthinkable before, athletes like Spanish endurance racer Kílian Jornet. 
Here's Kílian running up the Matterhorn. 
(Laughter) With a sweatshirt there tied around his waist. 
It's so steep he can't even run here. 
He's pulling up on a rope. 
This is a vertical ascent of more than 8,000 feet, and Kílian went up and down in under three hours. 
Amazing. 
And talented though he is, Kílian is not a physiological freak. 
Now that he has done this, other athletes will follow, just as other athletes followed after Sir Roger Bannister ran under four minutes in the mile. 
Changing technology, changing genes, and a changing mindset. 
Innovation in sports, whether that's new track surfaces or new swimming techniques, the democratization of sport, the spread to new bodies and to new populations around the world, and imagination in sport, an understanding of what the human body is truly capable of, have conspired to make athletes stronger, faster, bolder, and better than ever. 
Thank you very much. 
(Applause) 

So I thought, "I will talk about death." 
Seemed to be the passion today. 
Actually, it's not about death. 
It's inevitable, terrible, but really what I want to talk about is, I'm just fascinated by the legacy people leave when they die. 
That's what I want to talk about. 
So Art Buchwald left his legacy of humor with a video that appeared soon after he died, saying, "Hi! I'm Art Buchwald, and I just died." 
And Mike, who I met at Galapagos, a trip which I won at TED, is leaving notes on cyberspace where he is chronicling his journey through cancer. 
And my father left me a legacy of his handwriting through letters and a notebook. 
In the last two years of his life, when he was sick, he filled a notebook with his thoughts about me. 
He wrote about my strengths, weaknesses, and gentle suggestions for improvement, quoting specific incidents, and held a mirror to my life. 
After he died, I realized that no one writes to me anymore. 
Handwriting is a disappearing art. 
I'm all for email and thinking while typing, but why give up old habits for new? 
Why can't we have letter writing and email exchange in our lives? 
There are times when I want to trade all those years that I was too busy to sit with my dad and chat with him, and trade all those years for one hug. 
But too late. 
But that's when I take out his letters and I read them, and the paper that touched his hand is in mine, and I feel connected to him. 
So maybe we all need to leave our children with a value legacy, and not a financial one. 
A value for things with a personal touch -- an autographed book, a soul-searching letter. 
If a fraction of this powerful TED audience could be inspired to buy a beautiful paper -- John, it'll be a recycled one -- and write a beautiful letter to someone they love, we actually may start a revolution where our children may go to penmanship classes. 
So what do I plan to leave for my son? 
I collect autographed books, and those of you authors in the audience know I hound you for them -- and CDs too, Tracy. 
I plan to publish my own notebook. 
As I witnessed my father's body being swallowed by fire, I sat by his funeral pyre and wrote. 
I have no idea how I'm going to do it, but I am committed to compiling his thoughts and mine into a book, and leave that published book for my son. 
I'd like to end with a few verses of what I wrote at my father's cremation. 
And those linguists, please pardon the grammar, because I've not looked at it in the last 10 years. 
I took it out for the first time to come here. 
"Picture in a frame, ashes in a bottle, boundless energy confined in the bottle, forcing me to deal with reality, forcing me to deal with being grown up. 
I hear you and I know that you would want me to be strong, but right now, I am being sucked down, surrounded and suffocated by these raging emotional waters, craving to cleanse my soul, trying to emerge on a firm footing one more time, to keep on fighting and flourishing just as you taught me. 
Your encouraging whispers in my whirlpool of despair, holding me and heaving me to shores of sanity, to live again and to love again." 
Thank you. 

I'm going to talk about how AI and mankind can coexist, but first, we have to rethink about our human values. 
So let me first make a confession about my errors in my values. 
It was 11 o'clock, December 16, 1991. 
I was about to become a father for the first time. 
My wife, Shen-Ling, lay in the hospital bed going through a very difficult 12-hour labor. 
I sat by her bedside but looked anxiously at my watch, and I knew something that she didn't. 
I knew that if in one hour, our child didn't come, I was going to leave her there and go back to work and make a presentation about AI to my boss, Apple's CEO. 
Fortunately, my daughter was born at 11:30 -- (Laughter) (Applause) sparing me from doing the unthinkable, and to this day, I am so sorry for letting my work ethic take precedence over love for my family. 
(Applause) My AI talk, however, went off brilliantly. 
(Laughter) Apple loved my work and decided to announce it at TED1992, 26 years ago on this very stage. 
I thought I had made one of the biggest, most important discoveries in AI, and so did the "Wall Street Journal" on the following day. 
But as far as discoveries went, it turned out, I didn't discover India, or America. 
Perhaps I discovered a little island off of Portugal. 
But the AI era of discovery continued, and more scientists poured their souls into it. 
About 10 years ago, the grand AI discovery was made by three North American scientists, and it's known as deep learning. 
Deep learning is a technology that can take a huge amount of data within one single domain and learn to predict or decide at superhuman accuracy. 
For example, if we show the deep learning network a massive number of food photos, it can recognize food such as hot dog or no hot dog. 
(Applause) Or if we show it many pictures and videos and sensor data from driving on the highway, it can actually drive a car as well as a human being on the highway. 
And what if we showed this deep learning network all the speeches made by President Trump? 
Then this artificially intelligent President Trump, actually the network -- (Laughter) can -- (Applause) You like double oxymorons, huh? 
(Laughter) (Applause) So this network, if given the request to make a speech about AI, he, or it, might say -- (Recording) Donald Trump: It's a great thing to build a better world with artificial intelligence. 
Kai-Fu Lee: And maybe in another language? 
DT: (Speaking Chinese) (Laughter) KFL: You didn't know he knew Chinese, did you? 
So deep learning has become the core in the era of AI discovery, and that's led by the US. 
But we're now in the era of implementation, where what really matters is execution, product quality, speed and data. 
And that's where China comes in. 
Chinese entrepreneurs, who I fund as a venture capitalist, are incredible workers, amazing work ethic. 
My example in the delivery room is nothing compared to how hard people work in China. 
As an example, one startup tried to claim work-life balance: "Come work for us because we are 996." 
And what does that mean? 
It means the work hours of 9am to 9pm, six days a week. 
That's contrasted with other startups that do 997. 
And the Chinese product quality has consistently gone up in the past decade, and that's because of a fiercely competitive environment. 
In Silicon Valley, entrepreneurs compete in a very gentlemanly fashion, sort of like in old wars in which each side took turns to fire at each other. 
(Laughter) But in the Chinese environment, it's truly a gladiatorial fight to the death. 
In such a brutal environment, entrepreneurs learn to grow very rapidly, they learn to make their products better at lightning speed, and they learn to hone their business models until they're impregnable. 
As a result, great Chinese products like WeChat and Weibo are arguably better than the equivalent American products from Facebook and Twitter. 
And the Chinese market embraces this change and accelerated change and paradigm shifts. 
As an example, if any of you go to China, you will see it's almost cashless and credit card-less, because that thing that we all talk about, mobile payment, has become the reality in China. 
In the last year, 18.8 trillion US dollars were transacted on mobile internet, and that's because of very robust technologies built behind it. 
It's even bigger than the China GDP. 
And this technology, you can say, how can it be bigger than the GDP? 
Because it includes all transactions: wholesale, channels, retail, online, offline, going into a shopping mall or going into a farmers market like this. 
The technology is used by 700 million people to pay each other, not just merchants, so it's peer to peer, and it's almost transaction-fee-free. 
And it's instantaneous, and it's used everywhere. 
And finally, the China market is enormous. 
This market is large, which helps give entrepreneurs more users, more revenue, more investment, but most importantly, it gives the entrepreneurs a chance to collect a huge amount of data which becomes rocket fuel for the AI engine. 
So as a result, the Chinese AI companies have leaped ahead so that today, the most valuable companies in computer vision, speech recognition, speech synthesis, machine translation and drones are all Chinese companies. 
So with the US leading the era of discovery and China leading the era of implementation, we are now in an amazing age where the dual engine of the two superpowers are working together to drive the fastest revolution in technology that we have ever seen as humans. 
And this will bring tremendous wealth, unprecedented wealth: 16 trillion dollars, according to PwC, in terms of added GDP to the worldwide GDP by 2030. 
It will also bring immense challenges in terms of potential job replacements. 
Whereas in the Industrial Age it created more jobs because craftsman jobs were being decomposed into jobs in the assembly line, so more jobs were created. 
But AI completely replaces the individual jobs in the assembly line with robots. 
And it's not just in factories, but truckers, drivers and even jobs like telesales, customer service and hematologists as well as radiologists over the next 15 years are going to be gradually replaced by artificial intelligence. 
And only the creative jobs -- (Laughter) I have to make myself safe, right? 
Really, the creative jobs are the ones that are protected, because AI can optimize but not create. 
But what's more serious than the loss of jobs is the loss of meaning, because the work ethic in the Industrial Age has brainwashed us into thinking that work is the reason we exist, that work defined the meaning of our lives. 
And I was a prime and willing victim to that type of workaholic thinking. 
I worked incredibly hard. 
That's why I almost left my wife in the delivery room, that's why I worked 996 alongside my entrepreneurs. 
And that obsession that I had with work ended abruptly a few years ago when I was diagnosed with fourth stage lymphoma. 
The PET scan here shows over 20 malignant tumors jumping out like fireballs, melting away my ambition. 
But more importantly, it helped me reexamine my life. 
Knowing that I may only have a few months to live caused me to see how foolish it was for me to base my entire self-worth on how hard I worked and the accomplishments from hard work. 
My priorities were completely out of order. 
I neglected my family. 
My father had passed away, and I never had a chance to tell him I loved him. 
My mother had dementia and no longer recognized me, and my children had grown up. 
During my chemotherapy, I read a book by Bronnie Ware who talked about dying wishes and regrets of the people in the deathbed. 
She found that facing death, nobody regretted that they didn't work hard enough in this life. 
They only regretted that they didn't spend enough time with their loved ones and that they didn't spread their love. 
So I am fortunately today in remission. 
(Applause) So I can be back at TED again to share with you that I have changed my ways. 
I now only work 965 -- occasionally 996, but usually 965. 
I moved closer to my mother, my wife usually travels with me, and when my kids have vacation, if they don't come home, I go to them. 
So it's a new form of life that helped me recognize how important it is that love is for me, and facing death helped me change my life, but it also helped me see a new way of how AI should impact mankind and work and coexist with mankind, that really, AI is taking away a lot of routine jobs, but routine jobs are not what we're about. 
Why we exist is love. 
When we hold our newborn baby, love at first sight, or when we help someone in need, humans are uniquely able to give and receive love, and that's what differentiates us from AI. 
Despite what science fiction may portray, I can responsibly tell you that AI has no love. 
When AlphaGo defeated the world champion Ke Jie, while Ke Jie was crying and loving the game of go, AlphaGo felt no happiness from winning and certainly no desire to hug a loved one. 
So how do we differentiate ourselves as humans in the age of AI? 
We talked about the axis of creativity, and certainly that is one possibility, and now we introduce a new axis that we can call compassion, love, or empathy. 
Those are things that AI cannot do. 
So as AI takes away the routine jobs, I like to think we can, we should and we must create jobs of compassion. 
You might ask how many of those there are, but I would ask you: Do you not think that we are going to need a lot of social workers to help us make this transition? 
Do you not think we need a lot of compassionate caregivers to give more medical care to more people? 
Do you not think we're going to need 10 times more teachers to help our children find their way to survive and thrive in this brave new world? 
And with all the newfound wealth, should we not also make labors of love into careers and let elderly accompaniment or homeschooling become careers also? 
(Applause) This graph is surely not perfect, but it points at four ways that we can work with AI. 
AI will come and take away the routine jobs and in due time, we will be thankful. 
AI will become great tools for the creatives so that scientists, artists, musicians and writers can be even more creative. 
AI will work with humans as analytical tools that humans can wrap their warmth around for the high-compassion jobs. 
And we can always differentiate ourselves with the uniquely capable jobs that are both compassionate and creative, using and leveraging our irreplaceable brains and hearts. 
So there you have it: a blueprint of coexistence for humans and AI. 
AI is serendipity. 
It is here to liberate us from routine jobs, and it is here to remind us what it is that makes us human. 
So let us choose to embrace AI and to love one another. 
Thank you. 
(Applause) 

I'm an industrial engineer. 
The goal in my life has always been to make more and more products in the least amount of time and resources. 
While working at Toyota, all I knew was how to make cars until I met Dr. Akira Miyawaki, who came to our factory to make a forest in it in order to make it carbon-neutral. 
I was so fascinated that I decided to learn this methodology by joining his team as a volunteer. 
Soon, I started making a forest in the backyard of my own house, and this is how it looks after three years. 
These forests, compared to a conventional plantation, grow 10 times faster, they're 30 times more dense, and 100 times more biodiverse. 
Within two years of having this forest in our backyard, I could observe that the groundwater didn't dry during summers, the number of bird species I spotted in this area doubled. 
Quality of air became better, and we started harvesting seasonal fruits growing effortlessly right in the backyard of our house. 
I wanted to make more of these forests. 
I was so moved by these results that I wanted to make these forests with the same acumen with which we make cars or write software or do any mainstream business, so I founded a company which is an end-to-end service provider to create these native natural forests. 
But to make afforestation as a mainstream business or an industry, we had to standardize the process of forest-making. 
So we benchmarked the Toyota Production System known for its quality and efficiency for the process of forest-making. 
For an example, the core of TPS, Toyota Production System, lies in heijunka, which is making manufacturing of different models of cars on a single assembly line. 
We replaced these cars with trees, using which now we can make multi-layered forests. 
These forests utilize 100 percent vertical space. 
They are so dense that one can't even walk into them. 
For an example, we can make a 300-tree forest in an area as small as the parking spaces of six cars. 
In order to reduce cost and our own carbon footprint, we started utilizing local biomass as soil amender and fertilizers. 
For example, coconut shells crushed in a machine mixed with rice straw, powder of rice husk mixed with organic manure is finally dumped in soil on which our forest is planted. 
Once planted, we use grass or rice straw to cover the soil so that all the water which goes into irrigation doesn't get evaporated back into the atmosphere. 
And using these simple improvisations, today we can make a forest for a cost as low as the cost of an iPhone. 
Today, we are making forests in houses, in schools, even in factories with the corporates. 
But that's not enough. 
There is a huge number of people who want to take matters into their own hands. 
So we let it happen. 
Today, we are working on an Internet-based platform where we are going to share our methodology on an open source using which anyone and everyone can make their own forest without our physical presence being there, using our methodology. 
At the click of a button, they can get to know all the native species of their place. 
By installing a small hardware probe on site, we can do remote soil testing, using which we can give step-by-step instructions on forest-making remotely. 
Also we can monitor the growth of this forest without being on site. 
This methodology, I believe, has a potential. 
By sharing, we can actually bring back our native forests. 
Now, when you go back home, if you see a barren piece of land, do remember that it can be a potential forest. 
Thank you very much. Thanks. 
(Applause) 

We do not choose where to be born. 
We do not choose who our parents are. 
But we do choose how we are going to live our lives. 
I did not choose to be born in South Sudan, a country rife with conflict. 
I did not choose my name -- Nyiriak, which means "war." 
I've always rejected it and all the legacy it was born into. 
I choose to be called Mary. 
As a teacher, I've stood in front of 120 students, so this stage does not intimidate me. 
My students come from war-torn countries. 
They're so different from each other, but they have one thing in common: they fled their homes in order to stay alive. 
Some of them belong to parents back home in South Sudan who are killing each other because they belong to a different tribe or they have a different belief. 
Others come from other African countries devastated by war. 
But when they enter my class, they make friends, they walk home together, they do their homework together. 
There is no hatred allowed in my class. 
My story is like that of so many other refugees. 
The war came when I was still a baby. 
And my father, who had been absent in most of my early childhood, was doing what other men were doing: fighting for the country. 
He had two wives and many children. 
My mother was his second wife, married to him at the age of 16. 
This is simply because my mother came from a poor background, and she had no choice. 
My father, on the other hand, was rich. 
He had many cows. 
Gunshots were the order of the day. 
My community was constantly under attack. 
Communities would fight each other as they took water along the Nile. 
But that was not all. 
Planes would drop the spinning and terrifying bombs that chopped off people's limbs. 
But the most terrifying thing for every single parent was to see their children being abducted and turned into young soldiers. 
My mother dug a trench that soon became our home. 
But yet, we did not feel protected. 
She had to flee in search of a safe place for us. 
I was four years old, and my younger sister was two. 
We joined a huge mass of people, and together we walked for many agonizing days in search of a secure place. 
But we could barely rest before we were attacked again. 
I remember my mother was pregnant, when she would take turns to carry me and my younger sister. 
We finally made it across the Kenyan border, yes. 
But that was the longest journey that I have ever had in my whole life. 
My feet were raw with blisters. 
To our surprise, we found other family members who had fled into the camp earlier on, where you all are today, the Kakuma camp. 
Now, I want you all to be very quiet just for a moment. 
Do you hear that? 
The sound of silence. 
No gunshots. 
Peace, at last. 
That was my first memory of this camp. 
When you move from a war zone and come to a secure place like Kakuma, you've really gone far. 
My father, who had been absent in most of my early childhood, came back into my life. 
And he organized for me to move with my uncle to our family in Nakuru. 
There, I found my father's first wife, my half sisters and my half brothers. 
I got enrolled in school. 
I remember my first day in school -- I could sing and laugh again -- and my first set of school uniforms, you bet. 
It was amazing. 
But then I came to realize that my uncle did not find it fit for me to go to school, simply because I was a girl. 
My half brothers were his first priority. 
He would say, "Educating a girl is a waste of time." 
And for that reason, I missed many days of school, because the fees were not paid. 
My father stepped in and organized for me to go to boarding school. 
I remember the faith that he put in me over the couple of years to come. 
He would say, "Education is an animal that you have to overcome. 
With an education, you can survive. 
Education shall be your first husband." 
And with these words came in his first big investment. 
I felt lucky! 
But I was missing something: my mother. 
My mother had been left behind in the camp, and I had not seen her since I left it. 
Six years without seeing her was really long. 
I was alone, in school, when I heard of her death. 
I've seen many people back in South Sudan lose their lives. 
I've heard from neighbors lose their sons, their husbands, their children. 
But I never thought that that would ever come into my life. 
A month earlier, my stepmother, who had been so good to me back in Nakuru, died first. 
Then I came to realize that after giving birth to four girls, my mother had finally given birth to something that could have made her be accepted into the community -- a baby boy, my baby brother. 
But he, too, joined the list of the dead. 
The most hurting part for me was the fact that I wasn't able to attend my mother's burial. 
I wasn't allowed. 
They said her family did not find it fit for her children, who are all girls, to attend her burial, simply because we were girls. 
They would lament to me and say, "We are sorry, Mary, for your loss. 
We are sorry that your parents never left behind any children." 
And I would wonder: What are we? 
Are we not children? 
In the mentality of my community, only the boy child counted. 
And for that reason, I knew this was the end of me. 
But I was the eldest girl. 
I had to take care of my siblings. 
I had to ensure they went to school. 
I was 13 years old. 
How could I have made that happen? 
I came back to the camp to take care of my siblings. 
I've never felt so stuck. 
But then, one of my aunts, Auntie Okoi, decided to take my sisters. 
My father sent me money from Juba for me to go back to school. 
Boarding school was heaven, but it was also so hard. 
I remember during the visiting days when parents would come to school, and my father would miss. 
But when he did come, he repeated the same faith in me. 
This time he would say, "Mary, you cannot go astray, because you are the future of your siblings." 
But then, in 2012, life took away the only thing that I was clinging on. 
My father died. 
My grades in school started to collapse, and when I sat for my final high school exams in 2015, I was devastated to receive a C grade. 
OK, I keep telling students in my class, "It's not about the A's; it's about doing your best." 
That was not my best. 
I was determined. 
I wanted to go back and try again. 
But my parents were gone. 
I had no one to take care of me, and I had no one to pay that fee. 
I felt so hopeless. 
But then, one of my best friends, a beautiful Kenyan lady, Esther Kaecha, called me during this devastating moment, and she was like, "Mary, you have a strong will. 
And I have a plan, and it's going to work." 
OK, when you're in those devastating moments, you accept anything, right? 
So the plan was, she organized some travel money for us to travel to Anester Victory Girls High School. 
I remember that day so well. 
It was raining when we entered the principal's office. 
We were shaking like two chickens that had been rained on, and we looked at him. 
He was asking, "What do you want?" 
And we looked at him with the cat face. 
"We just want to go back to school." 
Well, believe it or not, he not only paid our school fees but also our uniform and pocket money for food. 
Clap for him. 
(Applause) When I finished my high school career, I became the head girl. 
And when I sat for the KCSE for a second time, I was able to receive a B minus. Clap. 
(Applause) Thank you. 
So I really want to say thank you to Anester Victory, Mr. Gatimu and the whole Anester fraternity for giving me that chance. 
From time to time, members of my family will insist that my sister and I should get married so that somebody will take care of us. 
They will say, "We have a man for you." 
I really hate the fact that people took us as property rather than children. 
Sometimes they will jokingly say, "You are going to lose your market value the more educated you become." 
But the truth is, an educated woman is feared in my community. 
But I told them, this is not what I want. 
I don't want to get kids at 16 like my mother did. 
This is not my life. 
Even though my sisters and I are suffering, there's no way we are heading in that direction. 
I refuse to repeat history. 
Educating a girl will create equal and stable societies. 
And educated refugees will be the hope of rebuilding their countries someday. 
Girls and women have a part to play in this just as much as men. 
Well, we have men in my family that encourage me to move on: my half brothers and also my half sisters. 
When I finished my high school career, I moved my sisters to Nairobi, where they live with my stepsister. 
They live 17 people in a house. 
But don't pity us. 
The most important thing is that they all get a decent education. 
The winners of today are the losers of yesterday, but who never gave up. 
And that is who we are, my sisters and I. 
And I'm so proud of that. 
My biggest investment in life -- (Applause) is the education of my sisters. 
Education creates an equal and fair chance for everyone to make it. 
I personally believe education is not all about the syllabus. 
It's about friendship. 
It's about discovering our talents. 
It's about discovering our destiny. 
I will, for example, not forget the joy that I had when I first had singing lessons in school, which is still a passion of mine. 
But I wouldn't have gotten that anywhere else. 
As a teacher, I see my classroom as a laboratory that not only generates skills and knowledge but also understanding and hope. 
Let's take a tree. 
A tree may have its branches cut, but give it water, and it will grow new branches. 
For the child of war, an education can turn their tears of loss into a passion for peace. 
And for that reason, I refuse to give up on a single student in my class. 
(Applause) Education heals. 
The school environment gives you a focus to focus ahead. 
Let's take it this way: when you're busy solving mathematical equations, and you are memorizing poetry, you forget the violence that you witnessed back home. 
And that is the power of education. 
It creates this place for peace. 
Kakuma is teeming with learners. 
Over 85,000 students are enrolled in schools here, which makes up 40 percent of the refugee population. 
It includes children who lost years of education because of the war back home. 
And I want to ask you a question: If education is about building a generation of hope, why are there 120 students packed in my classroom? 
Why is it that only six percent of the primary school students are making it to high school, simply because we do not have enough places for them? 
And why is it that only one percent of the secondary school graduates are making it to university? 
I began by saying that I am a teacher. 
But once again, I have become a student. 
In March, I moved to Rwanda on a scholarship program called "Bridge2Rwanda." 
It prepares scholars for universities. 
They are able to get a chance to compete for universities abroad. 
I am now having teachers telling me what to do, instead of the other way round. 
People are once again investing in me. 
So I want to ask you all to invest in young refugees. 
Think of the tree that we mentioned earlier. 
We are the generation to plant it, so that the next generation can water it, and the one that follows will enjoy the shade. 
They will reap the benefits. 
And the greatest benefit of them all is an education that will last. 
Thank you. 
(Applause) 

(Music) (Applause) 

People don't realize that red light and benign near-infrared light go right through your hand, just like this. 
This fact could enable better, faster and cheaper health care. 
Our translucence is key here. 
I'm going to show you how we use this key and a couple of other keys to see deep inside our bodies and brains. 
OK, so first up ... 
You see this laser pointer and the spot it makes on my hand? 
The light goes right through my hand -- if we could bring the lights down, please -- as I've already shown. 
But you can no longer see that laser spot. 
You see my hand glow. 
That's because the light spreads out, it scatters. 
I need you to understand what scattering is, so I can show you how we get rid of it and see deep inside our bodies and brains. 
So, I've got a piece of chicken back here. 
(Laughter) It's raw. 
Putting on some gloves. 
It's got the same optical properties as human flesh. 
So, here's the chicken ... putting it on the light. 
Can you see, the light goes right through? 
I also implanted a tumor in that chicken. 
Can you see it? 
Audience: Yes. 
Mary Lou Jepsen: So this means, using red light and infrared light, we can see tumors in human flesh. 
But there's a catch. 
When I throw another piece of chicken on it, the light still goes through, but you can no longer see the tumor. 
That's because the light scatters. 
So we have to do something about the scatter so we can see the tumor. 
We have to de-scatter the light. 
So ... 
A technology I spent the early part of my career on enables de-scattering. 
It's called holography. 
And it won the Nobel Prize in physics in the 70s, because of the fantastic things it enables you to do with light. 
This is a hologram. 
It captures all of the light, all of the rays, all of the photons at all of the positions and all of the angles, simultaneously. 
It's amazing. 
To see what we can do with holography ... 
You see these marbles? 
Look at these marbles bouncing off of the barriers, as an analogy to light being scattered by our bodies. 
As the marbles get to the bottom of the scattering maze, they're chaotic, they're scattering and bouncing everywhere. 
If we record a hologram at the bottom inside of the screen, we can record the position and angle of each marble exiting the maze. 
And then we can bring in marbles from below and have the hologram direct each marble to exactly the right position and angle, such as they emerge in a line at the top of the scatter matrix. 
We're going to do that with this. 
This is optically similar to human brain. 
I'm going to switch to green light now, because green light is brighter to your eyes than red or infrared, and I really need you to see this. 
So we're going to put a hologram in front of this brain and make a stream of light come out of it. 
Seems impossible but it isn't. 
This is the setup you're going to see. 
Green light. 
Hologram here, green light going in, that's our brain. 
And a stream of light comes out of it. 
We just made a brain lase of densely scattering tissue. 
Seems impossible, no one's done this before, you're the first public audience to ever see this. 
(Applause) What this means is that we can focus deep into tissue. 
Our translucency is the first key. 
Holography enabling de-scattering is the second key to enable us to see deep inside of our bodies and brains. 
You're probably thinking, "Sounds good, but what about skull and bones? 
How are you going to see through the brain without seeing through bone?" 
Well, this is real human skull. 
We ordered it at skullsunlimited.com. 
(Laughter) No kidding. 
But we treat this skull with great respect at our lab and here at TED. 
And as you can see, the red light goes right through it. 
Goes through our bones. 
So we can go through skull and bones and flesh with just red light. 
Gamma rays and X-rays do that, too, but they cause tumors. 
Red light is all around us. 
So, using that, I'm going to come back here and show you something more useful than making a brain lase. 
We challenged ourselves to see how fine we could focus through brain tissue. 
Focusing through this brain, it was such a fine focus, we put a bare camera die in front of it. 
And the bare camera die ... 
Could you turn down the spotlight? 
OK, there it is. 
Do you see that? 
Each pixel is two-thousandths of a millimeter wide. 
Two microns. 
That means that spot focus -- full width half max -- is six to eight microns. 
To give you an idea of what that means: that's the diameter of the smallest neuron in the human brain. 
So that means we can focus through skull and brain to a neuron. 
No one has seen this before, we're doing this for the first time here. 
It's not impossible. 
(Applause) We made it work with our system, so we've made a breakthrough. 
(Laughter) Just to give an idea -- like, that's not just 50 marbles. 
That's billions, trillion of photons, all falling in line as directed by the hologram, to ricochet through densely scattering brain, and emerge as a focus. 
It's pretty cool. 
We're excited about it. 
This is an MRI machine. 
It's a few million dollars, it fills a room, many people have probably been in one. 
I've spent a lot of time in one. 
It has a focus of about a millimeter -- kind of chunky, compared to what I just showed you. 
A system based on our technology could enable dramatically lower cost, higher resolution and smaller medical imaging. 
So that's what we've started to do. 
My team and I have built a rig, a lab rig to scan out tissue. 
And here it is in action. 
We wanted to see how good we could do. 
We've built this over the last year. 
And the result is, we're able to find tumors in this sample -- 70 millimeters deep, the light going in here, half a millimeter resolution, and that's the tumor it found. 
You're probably looking at this, like, "Sounds good, but that's kind of a big system. 
It's smaller than a honking-big MRI machine, monster MRI machine, but can you do something to shrink it down?" 
And the answer is: of course. 
We can replace each big element in that system with a smaller component -- a little integrated circuit, a display chip the size of a child's fingernail. 
A bit about my background: I've spent the last two decades inventing, prototype-developing and then shipping billions of dollars of consumer electronics -- with full custom chips -- on the hairy edge of optical physics. 
So my team and I built the big lab rig to perfect our architecture and test the corner cases and really fine-tune our chip designs, before spending the millions of dollars to fabricate each chip. 
Our new chip inventions slim down the system, speed it up and enable rapid scanning and de-scattering of light to see deep into our bodies. 
This is the third key to enable better, faster and cheaper health care. 
This is a mock-up of something that can replace the functionality of a multimillion-dollar MRI machine into a consumer electronics price point, that you could wear as a bandage, line a ski hat, put inside a pillow. 
That's what we're building. 
(Applause) Oh, thanks! 
(Applause) So you're probably thinking, "I get the light going through our bodies. 
I even get the holography de-scattering the light. 
But how do we use these new chip inventions, exactly, to do the scanning?" 
Well, we have a sound approach. 
No, literally -- we use sound. 
Here, these three discs represent the integrated circuits that we've designed, that massively reduce the size of our current bulky system. 
One of the spots, one of the chips, emits a sonic ping, and it focuses down, and then we turn red light on. 
And the red light that goes through that sonic spot changes color slightly, much like the pitch of the police car siren changes as it speeds past you. 
So. 
There's this other thing about holography I haven't told you yet, that you need to know. 
Only two beams of exactly the same color can make a hologram. 
So, that's the orange light that's coming off of the sonic spot, that's changed color slightly, and we create a glowing disc of orange light underneath a neighboring chip and then record a hologram on the camera chip. 
Like so. 
From that hologram, we can extract information just about that sonic spot, because we filter out all of the red light. 
Then, we can optionally focus the light back down into the brain to stimulate a neuron or part of the brain. 
And then we move on to shift the sonic focus to another spot. 
And that way, spot by spot, we scan out the brain. 
Our chips decode holograms a bit like Rosalind Franklin decoded this iconic image of X-ray diffraction to reveal the structure of DNA for the first time. 
We're doing that electronically with our chips, recording the image and decoding the information, in a millionth of a second. 
We scan fast. 
Our system may be extraordinary at finding blood. 
And that's because blood absorbs red light and infrared light. 
Blood is red. 
Here's a beaker of blood. 
I'm going to show you. 
And here's our laser, going right through it. 
It really is a laser, you can see it on the -- there it is. 
In comparison to my pound of flesh, where you can see the light goes everywhere. 
So let's see that again, blood. 
This is really key: blood absorbs light, flesh scatters light. 
This is significant, because every tumor bigger than a cubic millimeter or two has five times the amount of blood as normal flesh. 
So with our system, you can imagine detecting cancers early, when intervention is easy, or tracking the size of your tumor as it grows or shrinks. 
Our system also should be extraordinary at finding out where blood isn't, like a clogged artery, or the color change in blood as it carries oxygen versus not carrying oxygen, which is a way to measure neural activity. 
There's a saying that "sunlight" is the best disinfectant. 
It's literally true. 
Researchers are killing pneumonia in lungs by shining light deep inside of lungs. 
Our system could enable this noninvasively. 
Let me give you three more examples of what this technology can do. 
One: stroke. 
There's two major kinds of stroke: the one caused by clogs and another caused by rupture. 
If you can determine the type of stroke within an hour or two, you can give medication to massively reduce the damage to the brain. 
Get the drug wrong, and the patient dies. 
Today, that means access to an MRI scanner within an hour or two of a stroke. 
Tomorrow, with compact, portable, inexpensive imaging, every ambulance and every clinic can decode the type of stroke and get the right therapy on time. 
(Applause) Thanks. 
Two: two-thirds of humanity lacks access to medical imaging. 
Compact, portable, inexpensive medical imaging can save countless lives. 
And three: brain-computer communication. 
I've shown here onstage our system focusing through skull and brain to the diameter of the smallest neuron. 
Using light and sound, you can activate or inhibit neurons, and simultaneously, we can match spec by spec the resolution of an fMRI scanner, which measures oxygen use in the brain. 
We do that by looking at the color change in the blood, rather than using a two-ton magnet. 
So you can imagine that with fMRI scanners today, we can decode the imagined words, images and dreams of those being scanned. 
We're working on a system that puts all three of these capabilities into the same system -- neural read and write with light and sound, while simultaneously mapping oxygen use in the brain -- all together in a noninvasive portable that can enable brain-computer communication, no implants, no surgery, no optional brain surgery required. 
This can do enormous good for the two billion people that suffer globally with brain disease. 
(Applause) People ask me how deep we can go. 
And the answer is: the whole body's in reach. 
But here's another way to look at it. 
(Laughter) My whole head just lit up, you want to see it again? 
Audience: Yes! 
(Laughter) MLJ: This looks scary, but it's not. 
What's truly scary is not knowing about our bodies, our brains and our diseases so we can effectively treat them. 
This technology can help. 
Thank you. 
(Applause) Thank you. 
(Applause) 

I'm Michael Shermer, director of the Skeptics Society, publisher of "Skeptic" magazine. 
We investigate claims of the paranormal, pseudo-science, fringe groups and cults, and claims of all kinds between, science and pseudo-science and non-science and junk science, voodoo science, pathological science, bad science, non-science, and plain old non-sense. 
And unless you've been on Mars recently, you know there's a lot of that out there. 
Some people call us debunkers, which is kind of a negative term. 
But let's face it, there's a lot of bunk. 
We are like the bunko squads of the police departments out there -- well, we're sort of like the Ralph Naders of bad ideas, (Laughter) trying to replace bad ideas with good ideas. 
I'll show you an example of a bad idea. 
I brought this with me, this was given to us by NBC Dateline to test. 
It's produced by the Quadro Corporation of West Virginia. 
It's called the Quadro 2000 Dowser Rod. 
(Laughter) This was being sold to high-school administrators for $900 apiece. 
It's a piece of plastic with a Radio Shack antenna attached to it. 
You could dowse for all sorts of things, but this particular one was built to dowse for marijuana in students' lockers. 
(Laughter) So the way it works is you go down the hallway, and you see if it tilts toward a particular locker, and then you open the locker. 
So it looks something like this. 
I'll show you. 
(Laughter) Well, it has kind of a right-leaning bias. 
Well, this is science, so we'll do a controlled experiment. 
It'll go this way for sure. 
(Laughter) Sir, do you want to empty your pockets, please, sir? 
(Laughter) So the question was, can it actually find marijuana in students' lockers? 
And the answer is, if you open enough of them, yes. 
(Laughter) (Applause) But in science, we have to keep track of the misses, not just the hits. 
And that's probably the key lesson to my short talk here: This is how psychics work, astrologers, tarot card readers and so on. 
People remember the hits and forget the misses. 
In science, we keep the whole database, and look to see if the number of hits somehow stands out from the total number you'd expect by chance. 
In this case, we tested it. 
We had two opaque boxes: one with government-approved THC marijuana, and one with nothing. 
And it got it 50 percent of the time -- (Laughter) which is exactly what you'd expect with a coin-flip model. 
So that's just a fun little example here of the sorts of things we do. 
"Skeptic" is the quarterly publication. Each one has a particular theme. 
This one is on the future of intelligence. 
Are people getting smarter or dumber? 
I have an opinion of this myself because of the business I'm in, but in fact, people, it turns out, are getting smarter. 
Three IQ points per 10 years, going up. 
Sort of an interesting thing. 
With science, don't think of skepticism as a thing, or science as a thing. 
Are science and religion compatible? 
It's like, are science and plumbing compatible? 
They're just two different things. 
Science is not a thing. It's a verb. 
It's a way of thinking about things. 
It's a way of looking for natural explanations for all phenomena. 
I mean, what's more likely: that extraterrestrial intelligences or multi-dimensional beings travel across vast distances of interstellar space to leave a crop circle in Farmer Bob's field in Puckerbrush, Kansas to promote skeptic.com, our web page? 
Or is it more likely that a reader of "Skeptic" did this with Photoshop? 
And in all cases we have to ask -- (Laughter) What's the more likely explanation? 
Before we say something is out of this world, we should first make sure that it's not in this world. 
What's more likely: that Arnold had extraterrestrial help in his run for the governorship, or that the "World Weekly News" makes stuff up? 
(Laughter) The same theme is expressed nicely here in this Sidney Harris cartoon. 
For those of you in the back, it says here: "Then a miracle occurs. 
I think you need to be more explicit here in step two." 
This single slide completely dismantles the intelligent design arguments. 
There's nothing more to it than that. 
(Applause) You can say a miracle occurs, it's just that it doesn't explain anything or offer anything. 
There's nothing to test. 
It's the end of the conversation for intelligent design creationists. 
And it's true, scientists sometimes throw terms out as linguistic place fillers -- dark energy or dark matter, something like that -- until we figure out what it is, we'll call it this. 
It's the beginning of the causal chain for science. 
For intelligent design creationists, it's the end of the chain. 
So again, we can ask this: what's more likely? 
Are UFOs alien spaceships, or perceptual cognitive mistakes, or even fakes? 
This is a UFO shot from my house in Altadena, California, looking down over Pasadena. 
And if it looks a lot like a Buick hubcap, it's because it is. 
You don't even need Photoshop or high-tech equipment, you don't need computers. 
This was shot with a throwaway Kodak Instamatic camera. 
You just have somebody off on the side with a hubcap ready to go. 
Camera's ready -- that's it. 
(Laughter) So, although it's possible that most of these things are fake or illusions or so on, and that some of them are real, it's more likely that all of them are fake, like the crop circles. 
On a more serious note, in all of science we're looking for a balance between data and theory. 
In the case of Galileo, he had two problems when he turned his telescope to Saturn. 
First of all, there was no theory of planetary rings. 
Second of all, his data was grainy and fuzzy, and he couldn't quite make out what he was looking at. 
So he wrote that he had seen -- "I have observed that the furthest planet has three bodies." 
And this is what he ended up concluding that he saw. 
So without a theory of planetary rings and with only grainy data, you can't have a good theory. 
It wasn't solved until 1655. 
This is Christiaan Huygens's book that catalogs all the mistakes people made trying to figure out what was going on with Saturn. 
It wasn't till Huygens had two things: He had a good theory of planetary rings and how the solar system operated, and he had better telescopic, more fine-grain data in which he could figure out that as the Earth is going around faster -- according to Kepler's Laws -- than Saturn, then we catch up with it. 
And we see the angles of the rings at different angles, there. 
And that, in fact, turns out to be true. 
The problem with having a theory is that it may be loaded with cognitive biases. 
So one of the problems of explaining why people believe weird things is that we have things, on a simple level, and then I'll go to more serious ones. 
Like, we have a tendency to see faces. 
This is the face on Mars. 
In 1976, where there was a whole movement to get NASA to photograph that area because people thought this was monumental architecture made by Martians. 
Here's the close-up of it from 2001. 
If you squint, you can still see the face. 
And when you're squinting, you're turning that from fine-grain to coarse-grain, so you're reducing the quality of your data. 
And if I didn't tell you what to look for, you'd still see the face, because we're programmed by evolution to see faces. 
Faces are important for us socially. 
And of course, happy faces, faces of all kinds are easy to see. 
You see the happy face on Mars, there. 
(Laughter) If astronomers were frogs, perhaps they'd see Kermit the Frog. 
Do you see him there? Little froggy legs. 
Or if geologists were elephants? 
Religious iconography. 
(Laughter) Discovered by a Tennessee baker in 1996. 
He charged five bucks a head to come see the nun bun till he got a cease-and-desist from Mother Teresa's lawyer. 
Here's Our Lady of Guadalupe and Our Lady of Watsonville, just down the street, or is it up the street from here? 
Tree bark is particularly good because it's nice and grainy, branchy, black-and-white splotchy and you can get the pattern-seeking -- humans are pattern-seeking animals. 
Here's the Virgin Mary on the side of a glass window in Sao Paulo. 
Here's when the Virgin Mary made her appearance on a cheese sandwich -- which I got to actually hold in a Las Vegas casino -- of course, this being America. 
(Laughter) This casino paid $28,500 on eBay for the cheese sandwich. 
(Laughter) But who does it really look like? The Virgin Mary? 
(Laughter) It has that sort of puckered lips, 1940s-era look. 
Virgin Mary in Clearwater, Florida. 
I actually went to see this one. 
There was a lot of people there. 
The faithful come in their wheelchairs and crutches, and so on. 
We went down and investigated. 
Just to give you a size, that's Dawkins, me and The Amazing Randi, next to this two, two and a half story-sized image. 
All these candles, thousands of candles people had lit in tribute to this. 
So we walked around the backside, to see what was going on. 
It turns out wherever there's a sprinkler head and a palm tree, you get the effect. 
Here's the Virgin Mary on the backside, which they started to wipe off. 
I guess you can only have one miracle per building. 
(Laughter) So is it really a miracle of Mary, or is it a miracle of Marge? 
(Laughter) And now I'm going to finish up with another example of this, with auditory illusions. 
There's this film, "White Noise," with Michael Keaton, about the dead talking back to us. 
By the way, the whole business of talking to the dead is not that big a deal. 
Anybody can do it, turns out. 
It's getting the dead to talk back that's the really hard part. 
(Laughter) In this case, supposedly, these messages are hidden in electronic phenomena. 
There's a ReverseSpeech.com web page where I downloaded this stuff. 
This is the most famous one of all of these. 
Here's the forward version of the very famous song. 
(Music with lyrics) If there's a bustle in your hedgerow don't be alarmed now. 
It's just a spring clean for the May Queen. 
Yes, there are two paths you can go by, but in the long run, There's still time to change the road you're on. 
(Music ends) Couldn't you just listen to that all day? 
All right, here it is backwards, and see if you can hear the hidden messages that are supposedly in there. 
(Music with unintelligible lyrics) (Lyrics) Satan! 
(Unintelligible lyrics continue) What did you get? Audience: Satan! 
Satan. OK, at least we got "Satan". 
Now, I'll prime the auditory part of your brain to tell you what you're supposed to hear, and then hear it again. 
(Music with lyrics) (Music ends) (Laughter) (Applause) You can't miss it when I tell you what's there. 
(Laughter) I'm going to just end with a positive, nice little story. 
The Skeptics is a nonprofit educational organization. 
We're always looking for little good things that people do. 
And in England, there's a pop singer. 
One of the top popular singers in England today, Katie Melua. 
And she wrote a beautiful song. 
It was in the top five in 2005, called, "Nine Million Bicycles in Beijing." 
It's a love story -- she's sort of the Norah Jones of the UK -- about how she much loves her guy, and compared to nine million bicycles, and so forth. 
And she has this one passage here. 
(Music) (Lyrics) We are 12 billion light-years from the edge That's a guess, No one can ever say it's true, But I know that I will always be with you. 
Michael Shermer: Well, that's nice. At least she got it close. 
In America it'd be, "We're 6,000 light years from the edge." 
(Laughter) But my friend, Simon Singh, the particle physicist now turned science educator, who wrote the book "The Big Bang," and so on, uses every chance he gets to promote good science. 
And so he wrote an op-ed piece in "The Guardian" about Katie's song, in which he said, well, we know exactly how far from the edge. 
You know, it's 13.7 billion light years, and it's not a guess. 
We know within precise error bars how close it is. 
So we can say, although not absolutely true, it's pretty close to being true. 
And, to his credit, Katie called him up after this op-ed piece came out, and said, "I'm so embarrassed. I was in the astronomy club. 
I should've known better." 
And she re-cut the song. 
So I will end with the new version. 
(Music with lyrics) We are 13.7 billion light years from the edge of the observable universe. 
That's a good estimate with well-defined error bars. 
And with the available information, I predict that I will always be with you. 
(Laughter) How cool is that? 
(Applause) 

This is a kindergarten we designed in 2007. 
We made this kindergarten to be a circle. 
It's a kind of endless circulation on top of the roof. 
If you are a parent, you know that kids love to keep making circles. 
This is how the rooftop looks. 
And why did we design this? 
The principal of this kindergarten said, "No, I don't want a handrail." 
I said, "It's impossible." 
But he insisted: "How about having a net sticking out from the edge of the roof? 
So that it can catch the children falling off?" 
(Laughter) I said, "It's impossible." 
And of course, the government official said, "Of course you have to have a handrail." 
But we could keep that idea around the trees. 
There are three trees popping through. 
And we were allowed to call this rope as a handrail. 
But of course, rope has nothing to do with them. 
They fall into the net. 
And you get more, and more, more. 
(Laughter) Sometimes 40 children are around a tree. 
The boy on the branch, he loves the tree so he is eating the tree. 
(Laughter) And at the time of an event, they sit on the edge. 
It looks so nice from underneath. 
Monkeys in the zoo. 
(Laughter) Feeding time. 
(Laughter) (Applause) And we made the roof as low as possible, because we wanted to see children on top of the roof, not only underneath the roof. 
And if the roof is too high, you see only the ceiling. 
And the leg washing place -- there are many kinds of water taps. 
You see with the flexible tubes, you want to spray water to your friends, and the shower, and the one in front is quite normal. 
But if you look at this, the boy is not washing his boots, he's putting water into his boots. 
(Laughter) This kindergarten is completely open, most of the year. 
And there is no boundary between inside and outside. 
So it means basically this architecture is a roof. 
And also there is no boundary between classrooms. 
So there is no acoustic barrier at all. 
When you put many children in a quiet box, some of them get really nervous. 
But in this kindergarten, there is no reason they get nervous. 
Because there is no boundary. 
And the principal says if the boy in the corner doesn't want to stay in the room, we let him go. 
He will come back eventually, because it's a circle, it comes back. 
(Laughter) But the point is, in that kind of occasion, usually children try to hide somewhere. 
But here, just they leave and come back. 
It's a natural process. 
And secondly, we consider noise very important. 
You know that children sleep better in noise. 
They don't sleep in a quiet space. 
And in this kindergarten, these children show amazing concentration in class. 
And you know, our kind grew up in the jungle with noise. 
They need noise. 
And you know, you can talk to your friends in a noisy bar. 
You are not supposed to be in silence. 
And you know, these days we are trying to make everything under control. 
You know, it's completely open. 
And you should know that we can go skiing in -20 degrees in winter. 
In summer you go swimming. 
The sand is 50 degrees. 
And also, you should know that you are waterproof. 
You never melt in rain. 
So, children are supposed to be outside. 
So that is how we should treat them. 
This is how they divide classrooms. 
They are supposed to help teachers. 
They don't. 
(Laughter) I didn't put him in. 
A classroom. 
And a washbasin. 
They talk to each other around the well. 
And there are always some trees in the classroom. 
A monkey trying to fish another monkey from above. 
(Laughter) Monkeys. 
(Laughter) And each classroom has at least one skylight. 
And this is where Santa Claus comes down at the time of Christmas. 
This is the annex building, right next to that oval-shaped kindergarten. 
The building is only five meters tall with seven floors. 
And of course, the ceiling height is very low. 
So you have to consider safety. 
So, we put our children, a daughter and a son. 
They tried to go in. 
He hit his head. 
He's okay. His skull is quite strong. 
He is resilient. It's my son. 
(Laughter) And he is trying to see if it is safe to jump off. 
And then we put other children. 
The traffic jam is awful in Tokyo, as you know. 
(Laughter) The driver in front, she needs to learn how to drive. 
Now these days, kids need a small dosage of danger. 
And in this kind of occasion, they learn to help each other. 
This is society. This is the kind of opportunity we are losing these days. 
Now, this drawing is showing the movement of a boy between 9:10 and 9:30. 
And the circumference of this building is 183 meters. 
So it's not exactly small at all. 
And this boy did 6,000 meters in the morning. 
But the surprise is yet to come. 
The children in this kindergarten do 4,000 meters on average. 
And these children have the highest athletic abilities among many kindergartens. 
The principal says, "I don't train them. We leave them on top of the roof. 
Just like sheep." 
(Laughter) They keep running. 
(Laughter) My point is don't control them, don't protect them too much, and they need to tumble sometimes. 
They need to get some injury. 
And that makes them learn how to live in this world. 
I think architecture is capable of changing this world, and people's lives. 
And this is one of the attempts to change the lives of children. 
Thank you very much. 
(Applause) 

Isadora Duncan -- (Music) -- crazy, long-legged woman from San Francisco, got tired of this country, and she wanted to get out. 
Isadora was famous somewhere around 1908 for putting up a blue curtain, and she would stand with her hands over her solar plexus and she would wait, and she would wait, and then, she would move. 
(Music) Josh and I and Somi call this piece "The Red Circle and the Blue Curtain." 
Red circle. 
Blue curtain. 
But, this is not the beginning of the 20th century. 
This is a morning in Vancouver in 2015. 
(Music) (Singing) Come on, Josh! 
(Music) (Singing) Go! 
Are we there yet? 
I don't think so. 
Hey, yeah! 
(Music) What time is it? 
(Music) Where are we? 
Josh. 
Somi. 
Bill T. 
Josh. 
Somi. 
Bill T. 
(Applause) Yeah, yeah!

Jeanie, Will and Adina are three senior citizens connected by a special relationship. 
They view their bond as a shield from the loneliness of aging. 
I first met them at a retirement home in Los Angeles, where I had been photographing for three years. 
I saw as they approached the gate one night, and felt an immediate connection to them. 
Although I didn't know the details of their love triangle, I intuitively felt that I had to find out who they were. 
Questioning a nurse a day later, she said to me, "Oh, you're talking about the threesome." 
(Laughter) I was intrigued. 
(Laughter) The trio set out on a daily adventure to coffee and doughnut shops, bus stops and street corners. 
I soon learned that the purpose of these outings was solace and a search for meaning. 
The trio sought to combat their alienation by literally integrating themselves in public streets. 
Yet, even when arm in arm, no one saw them. 
We often think that as we age, we lose the desires held in our youth. 
Actually, as a teenage photojournalist when I met the trio, I saw their behavior as a mirror to the fears of exclusion and desires for intimacy that I also carried. 
I related to their invisibility, which pained me during my childhood but has become my greatest asset as an immersive documentarian, because I can just fade into my empathy. 
As we walked down the streets of Hollywood, in a neighborhood of screenwriters, actors and filmmakers, the trio assumed the invisibility that each senior does. 
I would ask myself, "How is it that no one else sees these three human beings? 
Why is it that I am the only one who sees them?" 
Years later, as I began to share this work with the public, I noticed that people are largely uncomfortable with this story. 
Perhaps it is because the trio doesn't assume conventional notions associated with love, romance or partnership. 
They were unseen in public and shunned by their peers. 
They wanted to belong somewhere but only seemed to belong with each other. 
I wanted to belong somewhere, too. 
And my camera has been a catalyst for me to belong everywhere. 
But beyond challenging sociocultural norms about the elderly, the trio sheds light on fear of remoteness. 
At the end of each day, they return to their respective retirement homes. 
Under the surface of their aloneness, there is a desire for community, for their people. 
There was a sense that they were each yearning for their tribe, but that comfort comes with compromise, because Will cannot commit to one woman. 
Sitting with Jeanie one day in her apartment, she said to me, "Sharing Will is a thorn in your side. 
A relationship between a man and a woman is private. 
It is a couple, not a trio." 
My process is to essentially become the people I document by spending years with them as an observer-occupant, to create a safe space, to then become hidden in plain sight. 
I was about 17 when I met the trio, and I shadowed them for four years. 
We actually see, in the breakdown of social development, that adolescence and old age look strikingly alike, because both are periods of identity confusion. 
I identified with the women. 
But also with Will, who made me aware of the divide in me. 
The schism that we each often have about what we crave and the actuality of our situation. 
Before shooting this series, I was also in love with two different people who knew about each other, being the object over which they fought. 
But I also knew what it was like to be at the base of the triangle, like Jeanie or Adina, asking myself, "Why aren't I enough?" 
I would look through my viewfinder and see three elderly figures, and it became impossible to deny that regardless of age, we were each in pursuit of filling the proverbial hole through other people. 
Perhaps the discomfort of looking at Jeanie, Will and Adina's story is truly a reminder that even at the end of life, we may never reach the fantasy we have envisioned for ourselves. 
Thank you for listening. 
(Applause) 

In 2012, when I painted the minaret of Jara Mosque in my hometown of Gabés, in the south of Tunisia, I never thought that graffiti would bring so much attention to a city. 
At the beginning, I was just looking for a wall in my hometown, and it happened that the minaret was built in '94. 
And for 18 years, those 57 meters of concrete stayed grey. 
When I met the imam for the first time, and I told him what I wanted to do, he was like, "Thank God you finally came," and he told me that for years he was waiting for somebody to do something on it. 
The most amazing thing about this imam is that he didn't ask me anything -- neither a sketch, or what I was going to write. 
In every work that I create, I write messages with my style of calligraffiti -- a mix of calligraphy and graffiti. 
I use quotes or poetry. 
For the minaret, I thought that the most relevant message to be put on a mosque should come from the Quran, so I picked this verse: "Oh humankind, we have created you from a male and a female, and made you people and tribe, so you may know each other." 
It was a universal call for peace, tolerance, and acceptance coming from the side that we don't usually portray in a good way in the media. 
I was amazed to see how the local community reacted to the painting, and how it made them proud to see the minaret getting so much attention from international press all around the world. 
For the imam, it was not just the painting; it was really deeper than that. 
He hoped that this minaret would become a monument for the city, and attract people to this forgotten place of Tunisia. 
The universality of the message, the political context of Tunisia at this time, and the fact that I was writing Quran in a graffiti way were not insignificant. 
It reunited the community. 
Bringing people, future generations, together through Arabic calligraphy is what I do. 
Writing messages is the essence of my artwork. 
What is funny, actually, is that even Arabic-speaking people really need to focus a lot to decipher what I'm writing. 
You don't need to know the meaning to feel the piece. 
I think that Arabic script touches your soul before it reaches your eyes. 
There is a beauty in it that you don't need to translate. 
Arabic script speaks to anyone, I believe; to you, to you, to you, to anybody, and then when you get the meaning, you feel connected to it. 
I always make sure to write messages that are relevant to the place where I'm painting, but messages that have a universal dimension, so anybody around the world can connect to it. 
I was born and raised in France, in Paris, and I started learning how to write and read Arabic when I was 18. 
Today I only write messages in Arabic. 
One of the reasons this is so important to me, is because of all the reaction that I've experienced all around the world. 
In Rio de Janeiro, I translated this Portuguese poem from Gabriela Tôrres Barbosa, who was giving an homage to the poor people of the favela, and then I painted it on the rooftop. 
The local community were really intrigued by what I was doing, but as soon as I gave them the meaning of the calligraphy, they thanked me, as they felt connected to the piece. 
In South Africa, in Cape Town, the local community of Philippi offered me the only concrete wall of the slum. 
It was a school, and I wrote on it a quote from Nelson Mandela, saying, "[in Arabic]," which means, "It seems impossible until it's done." 
Then this guy came to me and said, "Man, why you don't write in English?" 
and I replied to him, "I would consider your concern legit if you asked me why I didn't write in Zulu." 
In Paris, once, there was this event, and someone gave his wall to be painted. 
And when he saw I was painting in Arabic, he got so mad -- actually, hysterical -- and he asked for the wall to be erased. 
I was mad and disappointed. 
But a week later, the organizer of the event asked me to come back, and he told me that there was a wall right in front of this guy's house. 
So, this guy -- (Laughter) like, was forced to see it every day. 
At the beginning, I was going to write, "[In Arabic]," which means, "In your face," but -- (Laughter) I decided to be smarter and I wrote, "[In Arabic]," which means, "Open your heart." 
I'm really proud of my culture, and I'm trying to be an ambassador of it through my artwork. 
And I hope that I can break the stereotypes we all know, with the beauty of Arabic script. 
Today, I don't write the translation of the message anymore on the wall. 
I don't want the poetry of the calligraphy to be broken, as it's art and you can appreciate it without knowing the meaning, as you can enjoy any music from other countries. 
Some people see that as a rejection or a closed door, but for me, it's more an invitation -- to my language, to my culture, and to my art. 
Thank you. 
(Applause) 

Well, we all need a reason to wake up. 
For me, it just took 11,000 volts. 
I know you're too polite to ask, so I will tell you. 
One night, sophomore year of college, just back from Thanksgiving holiday, a few of my friends and I were horsing around, and we decided to climb atop a parked commuter train. 
It was just sitting there, with the wires that run overhead. 
Somehow, that seemed like a great idea at the time. 
We'd certainly done stupider things. 
I scurried up the ladder on the back, and when I stood up, the electrical current entered my arm, blew down and out my feet, and that was that. 
Would you believe that watch still works? 
Takes a licking! 
(Laughter) My father wears it now in solidarity. 
That night began my formal relationship with death -- my death -- and it also began my long run as a patient. 
It's a good word. 
It means one who suffers. 
So I guess we're all patients. 
Now, the American health care system has more than its fair share of dysfunction -- to match its brilliance, to be sure. 
I'm a physician now, a hospice and palliative medicine doc, so I've seen care from both sides. 
And believe me: almost everyone who goes into healthcare really means well -- I mean, truly. 
But we who work in it are also unwitting agents for a system that too often does not serve. 
Why? 
Well, there's actually a pretty easy answer to that question, and it explains a lot: because healthcare was designed with diseases, not people, at its center. 
Which is to say, of course, it was badly designed. 
And nowhere are the effects of bad design more heartbreaking or the opportunity for good design more compelling than at the end of life, where things are so distilled and concentrated. 
There are no do-overs. 
My purpose today is to reach out across disciplines and invite design thinking into this big conversation. 
That is, to bring intention and creativity to the experience of dying. 
We have a monumental opportunity in front of us, before one of the few universal issues as individuals as well as a civil society: to rethink and redesign how it is we die. 
So let's begin at the end. 
For most people, the scariest thing about death isn't being dead, it's dying, suffering. 
It's a key distinction. 
To get underneath this, it can be very helpful to tease out suffering which is necessary as it is, from suffering we can change. 
The former is a natural, essential part of life, part of the deal, and to this we are called to make space, adjust, grow. 
It can be really good to realize forces larger than ourselves. 
They bring proportionality, like a cosmic right-sizing. 
After my limbs were gone, that loss, for example, became fact, fixed -- necessarily part of my life, and I learned that I could no more reject this fact than reject myself. 
It took me a while, but I learned it eventually. 
Now, another great thing about necessary suffering is that it is the very thing that unites caregiver and care receiver -- human beings. 
This, we are finally realizing, is where healing happens. 
Yes, compassion -- literally, as we learned yesterday -- suffering together. 
Now, on the systems side, on the other hand, so much of the suffering is unnecessary, invented. 
It serves no good purpose. 
But the good news is, since this brand of suffering is made up, well, we can change it. 
How we die is indeed something we can affect. 
Making the system sensitive to this fundamental distinction between necessary and unnecessary suffering gives us our first of three design cues for the day. 
After all, our role as caregivers, as people who care, is to relieve suffering -- not add to the pile. 
True to the tenets of palliative care, I function as something of a reflective advocate, as much as prescribing physician. 
Quick aside: palliative care -- a very important field but poorly understood -- while it includes, it is not limited to end of life care. 
It is not limited to hospice. 
It's simply about comfort and living well at any stage. 
So please know that you don't have to be dying anytime soon to benefit from palliative care. 
Now, let me introduce you to Frank. 
Sort of makes this point. 
I've been seeing Frank now for years. 
He's living with advancing prostate cancer on top of long-standing HIV. 
We work on his bone pain and his fatigue, but most of the time we spend thinking out loud together about his life -- really, about our lives. 
In this way, Frank grieves. 
In this way, he keeps up with his losses as they roll in, so that he's ready to take in the next moment. 
Loss is one thing, but regret, quite another. 
Frank has always been an adventurer -- he looks like something out of a Norman Rockwell painting -- and no fan of regret. 
So it wasn't surprising when he came into clinic one day, saying he wanted to raft down the Colorado River. 
Was this a good idea? 
With all the risks to his safety and his health, some would say no. 
Many did, but he went for it, while he still could. 
It was a glorious, marvelous trip: freezing water, blistering dry heat, scorpions, snakes, wildlife howling off the flaming walls of the Grand Canyon -- all the glorious side of the world beyond our control. 
Frank's decision, while maybe dramatic, is exactly the kind so many of us would make, if we only had the support to figure out what is best for ourselves over time. 
So much of what we're talking about today is a shift in perspective. 
After my accident, when I went back to college, I changed my major to art history. 
Studying visual art, I figured I'd learn something about how to see -- a really potent lesson for a kid who couldn't change so much of what he was seeing. 
Perspective, that kind of alchemy we humans get to play with, turning anguish into a flower. 
Flash forward: now I work at an amazing place in San Francisco called the Zen Hospice Project, where we have a little ritual that helps with this shift in perspective. 
When one of our residents dies, the mortuary men come, and as we're wheeling the body out through the garden, heading for the gate, we pause. 
Anyone who wants -- fellow residents, family, nurses, volunteers, the hearse drivers too, now -- shares a story or a song or silence, as we sprinkle the body with flower petals. 
It takes a few minutes; it's a sweet, simple parting image to usher in grief with warmth, rather than repugnance. 
Contrast that with the typical experience in the hospital setting, much like this -- floodlit room lined with tubes and beeping machines and blinking lights that don't stop even when the patient's life has. 
Cleaning crew swoops in, the body's whisked away, and it all feels as though that person had never really existed. 
Well-intended, of course, in the name of sterility, but hospitals tend to assault our senses, and the most we might hope for within those walls is numbness -- anesthetic, literally the opposite of aesthetic. 
I revere hospitals for what they can do; I am alive because of them. 
But we ask too much of our hospitals. 
They are places for acute trauma and treatable illness. 
They are no place to live and die; that's not what they were designed for. 
Now mind you -- I am not giving up on the notion that our institutions can become more humane. 
Beauty can be found anywhere. 
I spent a few months in a burn unit at St. Barnabas Hospital in Livingston, New Jersey, where I got really great care at every turn, including good palliative care for my pain. 
And one night, it began to snow outside. 
I remember my nurses complaining about driving through it. 
And there was no window in my room, but it was great to just imagine it coming down all sticky. 
Next day, one of my nurses smuggled in a snowball for me. 
She brought it in to the unit. 
I cannot tell you the rapture I felt holding that in my hand, and the coldness dripping onto my burning skin; the miracle of it all, the fascination as I watched it melt and turn into water. 
In that moment, just being any part of this planet in this universe mattered more to me than whether I lived or died. 
That little snowball packed all the inspiration I needed to both try to live and be OK if I did not. 
In a hospital, that's a stolen moment. 
In my work over the years, I've known many people who were ready to go, ready to die. 
Not because they had found some final peace or transcendence, but because they were so repulsed by what their lives had become -- in a word, cut off, or ugly. 
There are already record numbers of us living with chronic and terminal illness, and into ever older age. 
And we are nowhere near ready or prepared for this silver tsunami. 
We need an infrastructure dynamic enough to handle these seismic shifts in our population. 
Now is the time to create something new, something vital. 
I know we can because we have to. 
The alternative is just unacceptable. 
And the key ingredients are known: policy, education and training, systems, bricks and mortar. 
We have tons of input for designers of all stripes to work with. 
We know, for example, from research what's most important to people who are closer to death: comfort; feeling unburdened and unburdening to those they love; existential peace; and a sense of wonderment and spirituality. 
Over Zen Hospice's nearly 30 years, we've learned much more from our residents in subtle detail. 
Little things aren't so little. 
Take Janette. 
She finds it harder to breathe one day to the next due to ALS. 
Well, guess what? 
She wants to start smoking again -- and French cigarettes, if you please. 
Not out of some self-destructive bent, but to feel her lungs filled while she has them. 
Priorities change. 
Or Kate -- she just wants to know her dog Austin is lying at the foot of her bed, his cold muzzle against her dry skin, instead of more chemotherapy coursing through her veins -- she's done that. 
Sensuous, aesthetic gratification, where in a moment, in an instant, we are rewarded for just being. 
So much of it comes down to loving our time by way of the senses, by way of the body -- the very thing doing the living and the dying. 
Probably the most poignant room in the Zen Hospice guest house is our kitchen, which is a little strange when you realize that so many of our residents can eat very little, if anything at all. 
But we realize we are providing sustenance on several levels: smell, a symbolic plane. 
Seriously, with all the heavy-duty stuff happening under our roof, one of the most tried and true interventions we know of, is to bake cookies. 
As long as we have our senses -- even just one -- we have at least the possibility of accessing what makes us feel human, connected. 
Imagine the ripples of this notion for the millions of people living and dying with dementia. 
Primal sensorial delights that say the things we don't have words for, impulses that make us stay present -- no need for a past or a future. 
So, if teasing unnecessary suffering out of the system was our first design cue, then tending to dignity by way of the senses, by way of the body -- the aesthetic realm -- is design cue number two. 
Now this gets us quickly to the third and final bit for today; namely, we need to lift our sights, to set our sights on well-being, so that life and health and healthcare can become about making life more wonderful, rather than just less horrible. 
Beneficence. 
Here, this gets right at the distinction between a disease-centered and a patient- or human-centered model of care, and here is where caring becomes a creative, generative, even playful act. 
"Play" may sound like a funny word here. 
But it is also one of our highest forms of adaptation. 
Consider every major compulsory effort it takes to be human. 
The need for food has birthed cuisine. 
The need for shelter has given rise to architecture. 
The need for cover, fashion. 
And for being subjected to the clock, well, we invented music. 
So, since dying is a necessary part of life, what might we create with this fact? 
By "play" I am in no way suggesting we take a light approach to dying or that we mandate any particular way of dying. 
There are mountains of sorrow that cannot move, and one way or another, we will all kneel there. 
Rather, I am asking that we make space -- physical, psychic room, to allow life to play itself all the way out -- so that rather than just getting out of the way, aging and dying can become a process of crescendo through to the end. 
We can't solve for death. 
I know some of you are working on this. 
(Laughter) Meanwhile, we can -- (Laughter) We can design towards it. 
Parts of me died early on, and that's something we can all say one way or another. 
I got to redesign my life around this fact, and I tell you it has been a liberation to realize you can always find a shock of beauty or meaning in what life you have left, like that snowball lasting for a perfect moment, all the while melting away. 
If we love such moments ferociously, then maybe we can learn to live well -- not in spite of death, but because of it. 
Let death be what takes us, not lack of imagination. 
Thank you.

I am in search of another planet in the universe where life exists. 
I can't see this planet with my naked eyes or even with the most powerful telescopes we currently possess. 
But I know that it's there. 
And understanding contradictions that occur in nature will help us find it. 
On our planet, where there's water, there's life. 
So we look for planets that orbit at just the right distance from their stars. 
At this distance, shown in blue on this diagram for stars of different temperatures, planets could be warm enough for water to flow on their surfaces as lakes and oceans where life might reside. 
Some astronomers focus their time and energy on finding planets at these distances from their stars. 
What I do picks up where their job ends. 
I model the possible climates of exoplanets. 
And here's why that's important: there are many factors besides distance from its star that control whether a planet can support life. 
Take the planet Venus. 
It's named after the Roman goddess of love and beauty, because of its benign, ethereal appearance in the sky. 
But spacecraft measurements revealed a different story. 
The surface temperature is close to 900 degrees Fahrenheit, 500 Celsius. 
That's hot enough to melt lead. 
Its thick atmosphere, not its distance from the sun, is the reason. 
It causes a greenhouse effect on steroids, trapping heat from the sun and scorching the planet's surface. 
The reality totally contradicted initial perceptions of this planet. 
From these lessons from our own solar system, we've learned that a planet's atmosphere is crucial to its climate and potential to host life. 
We don't know what the atmospheres of these planets are like because the planets are so small and dim compared to their stars and so far away from us. 
For example, one of the closest planets that could support surface water -- it's called Gliese 667 Cc -- such a glamorous name, right, nice phone number for a name -- it's 23 light years away. 
So that's more than 100 trillion miles. 
Trying to measure the atmospheric composition of an exoplanet passing in front of its host star is hard. 
It's like trying to see a fruit fly passing in front of a car's headlight. 
OK, now imagine that car is 100 trillion miles away, and you want to know the precise color of that fly. 
So I use computer models to calculate the kind of atmosphere a planet would need to have a suitable climate for water and life. 
Here's an artist's concept of the planet Kepler-62f, with the Earth for reference. 
It's 1,200 light years away, and just 40 percent larger than Earth. 
Our NSF-funded work found that it could be warm enough for open water from many types of atmospheres and orientations of its orbit. 
So I'd like future telescopes to follow up on this planet to look for signs of life. 
Ice on a planet's surface is also important for climate. 
Ice absorbs longer, redder wavelengths of light, and reflects shorter, bluer light. 
That's why the iceberg in this photo looks so blue. 
The redder light from the sun is absorbed on its way through the ice. 
Only the blue light makes it all the way to the bottom. 
Then it gets reflected back to up to our eyes and we see blue ice. 
My models show that planets orbiting cooler stars could actually be warmer than planets orbiting hotter stars. 
There's another contradiction -- that ice absorbs the longer wavelength light from cooler stars, and that light, that energy, heats the ice. 
Using climate models to explore how these contradictions can affect planetary climate is vital to the search for life elsewhere. 
And it's no surprise that this is my specialty. 
I'm an African-American female astronomer and a classically trained actor who loves to wear makeup and read fashion magazines, so I am uniquely positioned to appreciate contradictions in nature -- (Laughter) (Applause) ... and how they can inform our search for the next planet where life exists. 
My organization, Rising Stargirls, teaches astronomy to middle-school girls of color, using theater, writing and visual art. 
That's another contradiction -- science and art don't often go together, but interweaving them can help these girls bring their whole selves to what they learn, and maybe one day join the ranks of astronomers who are full of contradictions, and use their backgrounds to discover, once and for all, that we are truly not alone in the universe. 
Thank you. 
(Applause) 

A few years ago, I got one of those spam emails. 
And it managed to get through my spam filter. 
I'm not quite sure how, but it turned up in my inbox, and it was from a guy called Solomon Odonkoh. 
(Laughter) I know. 
(Laughter) It went like this: it said, "Hello James Veitch, I have an interesting business proposal I want to share with you, Solomon." 
Now, my hand was kind of hovering on the delete button, right? 
I was looking at my phone. I thought, I could just delete this. 
Or I could do what I think we've all always wanted to do. 
(Laughter) And I said, "Solomon, Your email intrigues me." 
(Laughter) (Applause) And the game was afoot. 
He said, "Dear James Veitch, We shall be shipping Gold to you." 
(Laughter) "You will earn 10% of any gold you distributes." 
(Laughter) So I knew I was dealing with a professional. 
(Laughter) I said, "How much is it worth?" 
He said, "We will start with smaller quantity," -- I was like, aww -- and then he said, "of 25 kgs. 
(Laughter) The worth should be about $2.5 million." 
I said, "Solomon, if we're going to do it, let's go big. 
(Applause) I can handle it. How much gold do you have?" 
(Laughter) He said, "It is not a matter of how much gold I have, what matters is your capability of handling. 
We can start with 50 kgs as trial shipment." 
I said, "50 kgs? 
There's no point doing this at all unless you're shipping at least a metric ton." 
(Laughter) (Applause) He said, "What do you do for a living?" 
(Laughter) I said, "I'm a hedge fund executive bank manager." 
(Laughter) This isn't the first time I've shipped bullion, my friend, no no no. 
Then I started to panic. 
I don't know about you, but I think if we're going via the postal service, it ought to be signed for. 
That's a lot of gold." 
He said, "It will not be easy to convince my company to do larger quantity shipment." 
I said, "Solomon, I'm completely with you on this one. 
I'm putting together a visual for you to take into the board meeting. 
Hold tight." 
(Laughter) This is what I sent Solomon. 
(Laughter) (Applause) I don't know if we have any statisticians in the house, but there's definitely something going on. 
(Laughter) I said, "Solomon, attached to this email you'll find a helpful chart. 
I've had one of my assistants run the numbers. 
(Laughter) We're ready for shipping as much gold as possible." 
There's always a moment where they try to tug your heartstrings, and this was it for Solomon. 
He said, "I will be so much happy if the deal goes well, because I'm going to get a very good commission as well." 
And I said, "That's amazing, What are you going to spend your cut on?" 
And he said, "On RealEstate, what about you?" 
I thought about it for a long time. 
And I said, "One word; Hummus." 
(Laughter) "It's going places. 
(Laughter) I was in Sainsbury's the other day and there were like 30 different varieties. 
Also you can cut up carrots, and you can dip them. 
Have you ever done that, Solomon?" 
(Laughter) He said, "I have to go bed now." 
(Laughter) (Applause) "Till morrow. 
Have sweet dream." 
I didn't know what to say! 
I said, "Bonsoir my golden nugget, bonsoir." 
(Laughter) Guys, you have to understand, this had been going for, like, weeks, albeit hitherto the greatest weeks of my life, but I had to knock it on the head. 
It was getting a bit out of hand. 
Friends were saying, "James, do you want to come for a drink?" 
I was like, "I can't, I'm expecting an email about some gold." 
So I figured I had to knock it on the head. 
So I concocted a plan. 
I said, "Solomon, I'm concerned about security. 
When we email each other, we need to use a code." 
And he agreed. 
(Laughter) I said, "Solomon, I spent all night coming up with this code we need to use in all further correspondence: Lawyer: Gummy Bear. 
Bank: Cream Egg. 
Legal: Fizzy Cola Bottle. Claim: Peanut M&amp;Ms. 
Documents: Jelly Beans. 
Western Union: A Giant Gummy Lizard." 
(Laughter) I knew these were all words they use, right? 
I said, "Please call me Kitkat in all further correspondence." 
(Laughter) I didn't hear back. I thought, I've gone too far. 
I've gone too far. So I had to backpedal a little. 
I said, "Solomon, Is the deal still on? 
KitKat." 
(Laughter) Because you have to be consistent. 
Then I did get an email back from him. 
I said, "Dude, you have to use the code!" 
What followed is the greatest email I've ever received. 
(Laughter) I'm not joking, this is what turned up in my inbox. 
This was a good day. 
"The business is on. 
I am trying to raise the balance for the Gummy Bear -- (Laughter) so he can submit all the needed Fizzy Cola Bottle Jelly Beans to the Creme Egg, for the Peanut M&amp;Ms process to start. 
(Laughter) Send 1,500 pounds via a Giant Gummy Lizard." 
(Applause) And that was so much fun, right, that it got me thinking: like, what would happen if I just spent as much time as could replying to as many scam emails as I could? 
And that's what I've been doing for three years on your behalf. 
(Laughter) (Applause) Crazy stuff happens when you start replying to scam emails. 
It's really difficult, and I highly recommend we do it. 
I don't think what I'm doing is mean. 
There are a lot of people who do mean things to scammers. 
All I'm doing is wasting their time. 
And I think any time they're spending with me is time they're not spending scamming vulnerable adults out of their savings, right? 
And if you're going to do this -- and I highly recommend you do -- get yourself a pseudonymous email address. 
Don't use your own email address. 
That's what I was doing at the start and it was a nightmare. 
I'd wake up in the morning and have a thousand emails about penis enlargements, only one of which was a legitimate response -- (Laughter) to a medical question I had. 
But I'll tell you what, though, guys, I'll tell you what: any day is a good day, any day is a good day if you receive an email that begins like this: (Laughter) "I AM WINNIE MANDELA, THE SECOND WIFE OF NELSON MANDELA THE FORMER SOUTH AFRICAN PRESIDENT." 
I was like, oh! -- that Winnie Mandela. 
(Laughter) I know so many. 
"I NEED TO TRANSFER 45 MILLION DOLLARS OUT OF THE COUNTRY BECAUSE OF MY HUSBAND NELSON MANDELA'S HEALTH CONDITION." 
Let that sink in. 
She sent me this, which is hysterical. 
(Laughter) And this. 
And this looks fairly legitimate, this is a letter of authorization. 
But to be honest, if there's nothing written on it, it's just a shape! 
(Laughter) I said, "Winnie, I'm really sorry to hear of this. 
Given that Nelson died three months ago, I'd describe his health condition as fairly serious." 
(Laughter) That's the worst health condition you can have, not being alive. 
She said, "KINDLY COMPLY WITH MY BANKERS INSTRUCTIONS. 
ONE LOVE." 
(Laughter) I said, "Of course. NO WOMAN, NO CRY." 
(Laughter) (Applause) She said, "MY BANKER WILL NEED TRANSFER OF 3000 DOLLARS. ONE LOVE." 
(Laughter) I said, "no problemo. 
I SHOT THE SHERIFF." 
[ (BUT I DID NOT SHOOT THE DEPUTY) ] (Laughter) Thank you. 
(Applause) 

Imagine that you invented a device that can record my memories, my dreams, my ideas, and transmit them to your brain. 
That would be a game-changing technology, right? 
But in fact, we already possess this device, and it's called human communication system and effective storytelling. 
To understand how this device works, we have to look into our brains. 
And we have to formulate the question in a slightly different manner. 
Now we have to ask how these neuron patterns in my brain that are associated with my memories and ideas are transmitted into your brains. 
And we think there are two factors that enable us to communicate. 
First, your brain is now physically coupled to the sound wave that I'm transmitting to your brain. 
And second, we developed a common neural protocol that enabled us to communicate. 
So how do we know that? 
In my lab in Princeton, we bring people to the fMRI scanner and we scan their brains while they are either telling or listening to real-life stories. 
And to give you a sense of the stimulus we are using, let me play 20 seconds from a story that we used, told by a very talented storyteller, Jim O'Grady. 
(Audio) Jim O'Grady: So I'm banging out my story and I know it's good, and then I start to make it better -- (Laughter) by adding an element of embellishment. 
Reporters call this "making shit up." 
(Laughter) And they recommend against crossing that line. 
But I had just seen the line crossed between a high-powered dean and assault with a pastry. 
And I kinda liked it." 
Uri Hasson: OK, so now let's look into your brain and see what's happening when you listen to these kinds of stories. 
And let's start simple -- let's start with one listener and one brain area: the auditory cortex that processes the sounds that come from the ear. 
And as you can see, in this particular brain area, the responses are going up and down as the story is unfolding. 
Now we can take these responses and compare them to the responses in other listeners in the same brain area. 
And we can ask: How similar are the responses across all listeners? 
So here you can see five listeners. 
And we start to scan their brains before the story starts, when they're simply lying in the dark and waiting for the story to begin. 
As you can see, the brain area is going up and down in each one of them, but the responses are very different, and not in sync. 
However, immediately as the story is starting, something amazing is happening. 
(Audio) JO: So I'm banging out my story and I know it's good, and then I start to make it -- UH: Suddenly, you can see that the responses in all of the subjects lock to the story, and now they are going up and down in a very similar way across all listeners. 
And in fact, this is exactly what is happening now in your brains when you listen to my sound speaking. 
We call this effect "neural entrainment." 
And to explain to you what is neural entrainment, let me first explain what is physical entrainment. 
So, we'll look and see five metronomes. 
Think of these five metronomes as five brains. 
And similar to the listeners before the story starts, these metronomes are going to click, but they're going to click out of phase. 
(Clicking) Now see what will happen when I connect them together by placing them on these two cylinders. 
(Clicking) Now these two cylinders start to rotate. 
This rotation vibration is going through the wood and is going to couple all the metronomes together. 
And now listen to the click. 
(Synchronized clicking) This is what you call physical entrainment. 
Now let's go back to the brain and ask: What's driving this neural entrainment? 
Is it simply the sounds that the speaker is producing? 
Or maybe it's the words. 
Or maybe it's the meaning that the speaker is trying to convey. 
So to test it, we did the following experiment. 
First, we took the story and played it backwards. 
And that preserved many of the original auditory features, but removed the meaning. 
And it sounds something like that. 
(Audio) JO: (Unintelligible) And we flashed colors in the two brains to indicate brain areas that respond very similarly across people. 
And as you can see, this incoming sound induced entrainment or alignment in all of the brains in auditory cortices that process the sounds, but it didn't spread deeper into the brain. 
Now we can take these sounds and build words out of it. 
So if we take Jim O'Grady and scramble the words, we'll get a list of words. 
(Audio) JO: ... an animal ... assorted facts ... 
and right on ... pie man ... potentially ... my stories UH: And you can see that these words start to induce alignment in early language areas, but not more than that. 
Now we can take the words and start to build sentences out of them. 
(Audio) JO: And they recommend against crossing that line. 
He says: "Dear Jim, Good story. Nice details. 
Didn't she only know about him through me?" 
UH: Now you can see that the responses in all the language areas that process the incoming language become aligned or similar across all listeners. 
However, only when we use the full, engaging, coherent story do the responses spread deeper into the brain into higher-order areas, which include the frontal cortex and the parietal cortex, and make all of them respond very similarly. 
And we believe that these responses in higher-order areas are induced or become similar across listeners because of the meaning conveyed by the speaker, and not by words or sound. 
And if we are right, there's a strong prediction over here if I tell you the exact same ideas using two very different sets of words, your brain responses will still be similar. 
And to test it, we did the following experiment in my lab. 
We took the English story and translated it to Russian. 
Now you have two different sounds and linguistic systems that convey the exact same meaning. 
And you play the English story to the English listeners and the Russian story to the Russian listeners, and we can compare their responses across the groups. 
And when we did that, we didn't see responses that are similar in auditory cortices in language, because the language and sound are very different. 
However, you can see that the responses in high-order areas were still similar across these two groups. 
We believe this is because they understood the story in a very similar way, as we confirmed, using a test after the story ended. 
And we think that this alignment is necessary for communication. 
For example, as you can tell, I am not a native English speaker. 
I grew up with another language, and the same might be for many of you in the audience. 
And still, we can communicate. 
How come? 
We think we can communicate because we have this common code that presents meaning. 
So far, I've only talked about what's happening in the listener's brain, in your brain, when you're listening to talks. 
But what's happening in the speaker's brain, in my brain, when I'm speaking to you? 
To look in the speaker's brain, we asked the speaker to go into the scanner, we scan his brain and then compare his brain responses to the brain responses of the listeners listening to the story. 
You have to remember that producing speech and comprehending speech are very different processes. 
To our surprise, we saw that all these complex patterns within the listeners actually came from the speaker brain. 
So production and comprehension rely on very similar processes. 
And we also found the stronger the similarity between the listener's brain and the speaker's brain, the better the communication. 
So I know that if you are completely confused now, and I do hope that this is not the case, your brain responses are very different than mine. 
But I also know that if you really understand me now, then your brain ... and your brain ... and your brain are really similar to mine. 
Now, let's take all this information together and ask: How can we use it to transmit a memory that I have from my brain to your brains? 
So we did the following experiment. 
We let people watch, for the first time in their life, a TV episode from the BBC series "Sherlock," while we scanned their brains. 
And then we asked them to go back to the scanner and tell the story to another person that never watched the movie. 
So let's be specific. 
Think about this exact scene, when Sherlock is entering the cab in London driven by the murderer he is looking for. 
With me, as a viewer, there is a specific brain pattern in my brain when I watch it. 
Now, the exact same pattern, I can reactivate in my brain again by telling the word: Sherlock, London, murderer. 
And when I'm transmitting these words to your brains now, you have to reconstruct it in your mind. 
In fact, we see that pattern emerging now in your brains. 
And we were really surprised to see that the pattern you have now in your brains when I'm describing to you these scenes would be very similar to the pattern I had when I watched this movie a few months ago in the scanner. 
This starts to tell you about the mechanism by which we can tell stories and transmit information. 
Because, for example, now you're listening really hard and trying to understand what I'm saying. 
And I know that it's not easy. 
But I hope that at one point in the talk we clicked, and you got me. 
And I think that in a few hours, a few days, a few months, you're going to meet someone at a party, and you're going to tell him about this lecture, and suddenly it will be as if he is standing now here with us. 
Now you can see how we can take this mechanism and try to transmit memories and knowledge across people, which is wonderful, right? 
But our ability to communicate relies on our ability to have common ground. 
Because, for example, if I'm going to use the British synonym "hackney carriage" instead of "cab," I know that I'm going to be misaligned with most of you in the audience. 
This alignment depends not only on our ability to understand the basic concept; it also depends on our ability to develop common ground and understanding and shared belief systems. 
Because we know that in many cases, people understand the exact same story in very different ways. 
So to test it in the lab, we did the following experiment. 
We took a story by J.D. Salinger, in which a husband lost track of his wife in the middle of a party, and he's calling his best friend, asking, "Did you see my wife?" 
For half of the subjects, we said that the wife was having an affair with the best friend. 
For the other half, we said that the wife is loyal and the husband is very jealous. 
This one sentence before the story started was enough to make the brain responses of all the people that believed the wife was having an affair be very similar in these high-order areas and different than the other group. 
And if one sentence is enough to make your brain similar to people that think like you and very different than people that think differently than you, think how this effect is going to be amplified in real life, when we are all listening to the exact same news item after being exposed day after day after day to different media channels, like Fox News or The New York Times, that give us very different perspectives on reality. 
So let me summarize. 
If everything worked as planned tonight, I used my ability to vocalize sound to be coupled to your brains. 
And I used this coupling to transmit my brain patterns associated with my memories and ideas into your brains. 
In this, I start to reveal the hidden neural mechanism by which we communicate. 
And we know that in the future it will enable us to improve and facilitate communication. 
But these studies also reveal that communication relies on a common ground. 
And we have to be really worried as a society if we lose this common ground and our ability to speak with people that are slightly different than us because we let a few very strong media channels take control of the mic, and manipulate and control the way we all think. 
And I'm not sure how to fix it because I'm only a scientist. 
But maybe one way to do it is to go back to the more natural way of communication, which is a dialogue, in which it's not only me speaking to you now, but a more natural way of talking, in which I am speaking and I am listening, and together we are trying to come to a common ground and new ideas. 
Because after all, the people we are coupled to define who we are. 
And our desire to be coupled to another brain is something very basic that starts at a very early age. 
So let me finish with an example from my own private life that I think is a good example of how coupling to other people is really going to define who we are. 
This my son Jonathan at a very early age. 
See how he developed a vocal game together with my wife, only from the desire and pure joy of being coupled to another human being. 
(Both vocalizing) (Laughter) Now, think how the ability of my son to be coupled to us and other people in his life is going to shape the man he is going to become. 
And think how you change on a daily basis from the interaction and coupling to other people in your life. 
So keep being coupled to other people. 
Keep spreading your ideas, because the sum of all of us together, coupled, is greater than our parts. 
Thank you. 
(Applause) 

When trains began to shuttle people across the coutryside, many insisted they would never replace horses. 
Less than a century later, people repeated that same prediction about cars, telephones, radio, television, and computers. 
Each had their own host of detractors. 
Even some experts insisted they wouldn’t catch on. 
Of course, we can’t predict exactly what the future will look like or what new inventions will populate it. 
But time and time again, we’ve also failed to predict that the technologies of the present will change the future. 
And recent research has revealed a similar pattern in our individual lives: we’re unable to predict change in ourselves. 
Three psychologists documented our inability to predict personal change in a 2013 paper called, “The End of History Illusion.” Named after political scientist Francis Fukuyama’s prediction that liberal democracy was the final form of government, or as he called it, “the end of history,” their work highlights the way we see ourselves as finished products at any given moment. 
The researchers recruited over 7,000 participants ages 18 to 68. 
They asked half of these participants to report their current personality traits, values, and preferences, along with what each of those metrics had been ten years before. 
The other half described those features in their present selves, and predicted what they would be ten years in the future. 
Based on these answers, the researchers then calculated the degree of change each participant reported or predicted. 
For every age group in the sample, they compared the predicted changes to the reported changes. 
So they compared the degree to which 18-year-olds thought they would change to the degree to which 28-year-olds reported they had changed. 
Overwhelmingly, at all ages, people’s future estimates of change came up short compared to the changes their older counterparts recalled. 
20-year-olds expected to still like the same foods at 30, but 30-year-olds no longer had the same tastes. 
30-year-olds predicted they’d still have the same best friend at 40, but 40-year-olds had lost touch with theirs. 
And 40-year-olds predicted they’d maintain the same core values that 50-year-olds had reconsidered. 
While older people changed less than younger people on the whole, they underestimated their capacity for change just as much. 
Wherever we are in life, the end of history illusion persists: we tend to think that the bulk of our personal change is behind us. 
One consequence of this thinking is that we’re inclined to overinvest in future choices based on present preferences. 
On average, people are willing to pay about 60% more to see their current favorite musician ten years in the future than they’d currently pay to see their favorite musician from ten years ago. 
While the stakes involved in concert-going are low, we’re susceptible to similar miscalculations in more serious commitments, like homes, partners, and jobs. 
At the same time, there’s no real way to predict what our preferences will be in the future. 
Without the end of history Illusion, it would be difficult to make any long-term plans. 
So the end of history illusion applies to our individual lives, but what about the wider world? 
Could we be assuming that how things are now is how they will continue to be? 
If so, fortunately, there are countless records to remind us that the world does change, sometimes for the better. 
Our own historical moment isn’t the end of history, and that can be just as much a source of comfort as a cause for concern. 

When we're designing new products, services or businesses, the only time you'll know if they're any good, if the designs are good, is to see how they're used in the real world, in context. 
I'm reminded of that every time I walk past Highbury Fields in north London. 
It's absolutely beautiful. 
There's a big open green space. 
There's Georgian buildings around the side. 
But then there's this mud trap that cuts across the middle. 
People clearly don't want to walk all the way around the edge. 
Instead, they want to take the shortcut, and that shortcut is self-reinforcing. 
Now, this shortcut is called a desire path, and it's often the path of least resistance. 
I find them fascinating, because they're often the point where design and user experience diverge. 
Now at this point, I should apologize, because you guys are going to start seeing these everywhere. 
But today, I'm going to pick three I find interesting and share what actually it reminds me about launching new products and services. 
The first is in the capital city of Brazil -- Brasilia. 
And it reminds me that sometimes, you have to just focus on designing for a real need at low friction. 
Now, Brasilia is fascinating. 
It was designed by Niemeyer in the '50s. 
It was the golden age of flying, so he laid it out like a plane, as you can see there. 
Slightly worryingly, he put most of the important government buildings in the cockpit. 
But if you zoom in, in the very center of Brasilia, just where the point is there, you see it's littered with desire paths. 
They're absolutely everywhere. 
Now, they thought that they had future-proofed this design. 
They thought in the future we wouldn't need to walk anywhere -- we'd be able to drive -- so there was little need for walkways or pavements. 
But as you can see, there's a real need. 
These are very dangerous desire paths. 
If we just pick one, in the middle, you can see it crosses 15 lanes of traffic. 
It won't surprise you guys that Brasilia has five times the pedestrian accident rate of your average US city. 
People are resourceful. 
They'll always find the low-friction route to save money, save time. 
Not all these desire paths are dangerous, I was reminded flying here when I was in Heathrow. 
Many of us get frustrated when we're confronted with the obligatory walk through duty-free. 
It was amazing to me how many people refused to take the long, meandering path to the left, and just cut through to the right, cut through the desire path. 
The question that's interesting is: What do designers think when they see our behavior here? 
Do they think we're stupid? 
Do they think we're lazy? 
Or do they accept that this is the only truth? 
This is their product. 
We're effectively co-designing their product. 
So our job is to design for real needs at low friction, because if you don't, the customer will, anyway. 
The second desire path I wanted to share is at the University of California. 
And it reminds me that sometimes the best way to come up with a great design is just to launch it. 
Now, university campuses are fantastic for spotting desire paths. 
I think it's because students are always late and they're pretty smart. 
So they're dashing to lectures. 
They'll always find the shortcut. 
And the designers here knew that. 
So they built the buildings and then they waited a few months for the paths to form. 
They then paved them. 
(Laughter) Incredibly smart approach. 
In fact, often, just launching the straw man of a service can teach you what people really want. 
For example, Ayr Muir in Boston knew he wanted to open a restaurant. 
But where should it be? 
What should the menu be? 
He launched a service, in this case a food truck, and he changed the location each day. 
He'd write a different menu on the side in a whiteboard marker to figure out what people wanted. 
He now has a chain of restaurants. 
So it can be incredibly efficient to launch something to spot the desire paths. 
The third and final desire path I wanted to share with you is the UNIH. 
It reminds me that the world's in flux, and we have to respond to those changes. 
So as you'll guess, this is a hospital. 
I've marked for you on the left the Oncology Department. 
The patients would usually stay in the hotels down on the bottom right. 
This was a patient-centered organization, so they laid on cars for their patients. 
But what they realized when they started offering chemotherapy is the patients rarely wanted to get in cars. 
They were too nauseous, so they'd walk back to their hotels. 
This desire path that you see diagonally, formed. 
The patients even called it "The Chemo Trail." 
Now, when the hospital saw this originally, they tried to lay turf back over it, ignore it. 
But after a while, they realized it was an important need they were meeting for their patients, so they paved it. 
If we look back at the one in North London again, that desire path hasn't always been there. 
The reason it sprung up is people were traveling to the mighty Arsenal Football Club stadium on game days, from the Underground station you see on the bottom right. 
So you see the desire path. 
If we just wind the clock back a few years, when the stadium was being constructed, there is no desire path. 
So our job is to watch for these desire paths emerging, and, where appropriate, pave them, as someone did here. 
Someone installed a barrier, people started walking across and round the bottom as you see, and they paved it. 
(Laughter) But I think this is a wonderful reminder as well, that, actually, the world is in flux. 
It's constantly changing, because if you look at the top of this image, there's another desire path forming. 
So these three desire paths remind me we need to design for real human needs. 
I think empathy for what your customers want is probably the biggest leading indicator of business success. 
Design for real needs and design them in low friction, because if you don't offer them in low friction, someone else will, often the customer. 
Secondly, often the best way to learn what people really want is to launch your service. 
The answer is rarely inside the building. 
Get out there and see what people really want. 
And finally, in part because of technology, the world is incredibly flux at the moment. 
It's changing constantly. 
These desire paths are going to spring up faster than ever. 
Our job is to pick the appropriate ones and pave over them. 
Thank you very much. 
(Applause) 

This is a man-made forest. 
It can spread over acres and acres of area, or it could fit in a small space -- as small as your house garden. 
Age of this forest is just two years old. 
I have a forest in the backyard of my own house. 
It attracts a lot of biodiversity. 
(Bird call) I wake up to this every morning, like a Disney princess. 
(Laughter) I am an entrepreneur who facilitates the making of these forests professionally. 
We have helped factories, farms, schools, homes, resorts, apartment buildings, public parks and even a zoo to have one of such forests. 
A forest is not an isolated piece of land where animals live together. 
A forest can be an integral part of our urban existence. 
A forest, for me, is a place so dense with trees that you just can't walk into it. 
It doesn't matter how big or small they are. 
Most of the world we live in today was forest. 
This was before human intervention. 
Then we built up our cities on those forests, like São Paulo, forgetting that we belong to nature as well, as much as 8.4 million other species on the planet. 
Our habitat stopped being our natural habitat. 
But not anymore for some of us. 
A few others and I today make these forests professionally -- anywhere and everywhere. 
I'm an industrial engineer. 
I specialize in making cars. 
In my previous job at Toyota, I learned how to convert natural resources into products. 
To give you an example, we would drip the sap out of a rubber tree, convert it into raw rubber and make a tire out of it -- the product. 
But these products can never become a natural resource again. 
We separate the elements from nature and convert them into an irreversible state. 
That's industrial production. 
Nature, on the other hand, works in a totally opposite way. 
The natural system produces by bringing elements together, atom by atom. 
All the natural products become a natural resource again. 
This is something which I learned when I made a forest in the backyard of my own house. 
And this was the first time I worked with nature, rather than against it. 
Since then, we have made 75 such forests in 25 cities across the world. 
Every time we work at a new place, we find that every single element needed to make a forest is available right around us. 
All we have to do is to bring these elements together and let nature take over. 
To make a forest we start with soil. 
We touch, feel and even taste it to identify what properties it lacks. 
If the soil is made up of small particles it becomes compact -- so compact, that water cannot seep in. 
We mix some local biomass available around, which can help soil become more porous. 
Water can now seep in. 
If the soil doesn't have the capacity to hold water, we will mix some more biomass -- some water-absorbent material like peat or bagasse, so soil can hold this water and it stays moist. 
To grow, plants need water, sunlight and nutrition. 
What if the soil doesn't have any nutrition in it? 
We don't just add nutrition directly to the soil. 
That would be the industrial way. 
It goes against nature. 
We instead add microorganisms to the soil. 
They produce the nutrients in the soil naturally. 
They feed on the biomass we have mixed in the soil, so all they have to do is eat and multiply. 
And as their number grows, the soil starts breathing again. 
It becomes alive. 
We survey the native tree species of the place. 
How do we decide what's native or not? 
Well, whatever existed before human intervention is native. 
That's the simple rule. 
We survey a national park to find the last remains of a natural forest. 
We survey the sacred groves, or sacred forests around old temples. 
And if we don't find anything at all, we go to museums to see the seeds or wood of trees existing there a long time ago. 
We research old paintings, poems and literature from the place, to identify the tree species belonging there. 
Once we know our trees, we divide them in four different layers: shrub layer, sub-tree layer, tree layer and canopy layer. 
We fix the ratios of each layer, and then we decide the percentage of each tree species in the mix. 
If we are making a fruit forest, we increase the percentage of fruit-bearing trees. 
It could be a flowering forest, a forest that attracts a lot of birds or bees, or it could simply be a native, wild evergreen forest. 
We collect the seeds and germinate saplings out of them. 
We make sure that trees belonging to the same layer are not planted next to each other, or they will fight for the same vertical space when they grow tall. 
We plant the saplings close to each other. 
On the surface, we spread a thick layer of mulch, so when it's hot outside the soil stays moist. 
When it's cold, frost formation happens only on the mulch, so soil can still breathe while it's freezing outside. 
The soil is very soft -- so soft, that roots can penetrate into it easily, rapidly. 
Initially, the forest doesn't seem like it's growing, but it's growing under the surface. 
In the first three months, roots reach a depth of one meter. 
These roots form a mesh, tightly holding the soil. 
Microbes and fungi live throughout this network of roots. 
So if some nutrition is not available in the vicinity of a tree, these microbes are going to get the nutrition to the tree. 
Whenever it rains, magically, mushrooms appear overnight. 
And this means the soil below has a healthy fungal network. 
Once these roots are established, forest starts growing on the surface. 
As the forest grows we keep watering it -- for the next two to three years, we water the forest. 
We want to keep all the water and soil nutrition only for our trees, so we remove the weeds growing on the ground. 
As this forest grows, it blocks the sunlight. 
Eventually, the forest becomes so dense that sunlight can't reach the ground anymore. 
Weeds cannot grow now, because they need sunlight as well. 
At this stage, every single drop of water that falls into the forest doesn't evaporate back into the atmosphere. 
This dense forest condenses the moist air and retains its moisture. 
We gradually reduce and eventually stop watering the forest. 
And even without watering, the forest floor stays moist and sometimes even dark. 
Now, when a single leaf falls on this forest floor, it immediately starts decaying. 
This decayed biomass forms humus, which is food for the forest. 
As the forest grows, more leaves fall on the surface -- it means more humus is produced, it means more food so the forest can grow still bigger. 
And this forest keeps growing exponentially. 
Once established, these forests are going to regenerate themselves again and again -- probably forever. 
In a natural forest like this, no management is the best management. 
It's a tiny jungle party. 
(Laughter) This forest grows as a collective. 
If the same trees -- same species -- would have been planted independently, it wouldn't grow so fast. 
And this is how we create a 100-year-old forest in just 10 years. 
Thank you very much. 
(Applause) 

Who do you want to be? 
It's a simple question, and whether you know it or not, you're answering it every day through your actions. 
This one question will define your professional success more than any other, because how you show up and treat people means everything. 
Either you lift people up by respecting them, making them feel valued, appreciated and heard, or you hold people down by making them feel small, insulted, disregarded or excluded. 
And who you choose to be means everything. 
I study the effects of incivility on people. 
What is incivility? 
It's disrespect or rudeness. 
It includes a lot of different behaviors, from mocking or belittling someone to teasing people in ways that sting to telling offensive jokes to texting in meetings. 
And what's uncivil to one person may be absolutely fine to another. 
Take texting while someone's speaking to you. 
Some of us may find it rude, others may think it's absolutely civil. 
So it really depends. 
It's all in the eyes of the beholder and whether that person felt disrespected. 
We may not mean to make someone feel that way, but when we do, it has consequences. 
Over 22 years ago, I vividly recall walking into this stuffy hospital room. 
It was heartbreaking to see my dad, this strong, athletic, energetic guy, lying in the bed with electrodes strapped to his bare chest. 
What put him there was work-related stress. 
For over a decade, he suffered an uncivil boss. 
But just a couple years later, I witnessed and experienced a lot of incivility in my first job out of college. 
I spent a year going to work every day and hearing things from coworkers like, "Are you an idiot? That's not how it's done," and, "If I wanted your opinion, I'd ask." 
So I did the natural thing. 
I quit, and I went back to grad school to study the effects of this. 
There, I met Christine Pearson. 
And she had a theory that small, uncivil actions can lead to much bigger problems like aggression and violence. 
We believed that incivility affected performance and the bottom line. 
So we launched a study, and what we found was eye-opening. 
We sent a survey to business school alumni working in all different organizations. 
We asked them to write a few sentences about one experience where they were treated rudely, disrespectfully or insensitively, and to answer questions about how they reacted. 
One person told us about a boss that made insulting statements like, "That's kindergartner's work," and another tore up someone's work in front of the entire team. 
And what we found is that incivility made people less motivated: 66 percent cut back work efforts, 80 percent lost time worrying about what happened, and 12 percent left their job. 
And after we published these results, two things happened. 
One, we got calls from organizations. 
Cisco read about these numbers, took just a few of these and estimated, conservatively, that incivility was costing them 12 million dollars a year. 
The second thing that happened was, we heard from others in our academic field who said, "Well, people are reporting this, but how can you really show it? 
Does people's performance really suffer?" 
I was curious about that, too. 
With Amir Erez, I compared those that experienced incivility to those that didn't experience incivility. 
And what we found is that those that experience incivility do actually function much worse. 
"OK," you may say. "This makes sense. 
After all, it's natural that their performance suffers." 
But what about if you're not the one who experiences it? 
What if you just see or hear it? 
You're a witness. 
We wondered if it affected witnesses, too. 
So we conducted studies where five participants would witness an experimenter act rudely to someone who arrived late to the study. 
The experimenter said, "What is it with you? 
You arrive late, you're irresponsible. 
Look at you! How do you expect to hold a job in the real world?" 
And in another study in a small group, we tested the effects of a peer insulting a group member. 
Now, what we found was really interesting, because witnesses' performance decreased, too -- and not just marginally, quite significantly. 
Incivility is a bug. 
It's contagious, and we become carriers of it just by being around it. 
And this isn't confined to the workplace. 
We can catch this virus anywhere -- at home, online, in schools and in our communities. 
It affects our emotions, our motivation, our performance and how we treat others. 
It even affects our attention and can take some of our brainpower. 
And this happens not only if we experience incivility or we witness it. 
It can happen even if we just see or read rude words. 
Let me give you an example of what I mean. 
To test this, we gave people combinations of words to use to make a sentence. 
But we were very sneaky. 
Half the participants got a list with 15 words used to trigger rudeness: impolitely, interrupt, obnoxious, bother. 
Half the participants received a list of words with none of these rude triggers. 
And what we found was really surprising, because the people who got the rude words were five times more likely to miss information right in front of them on the computer screen. 
And as we continued this research, what we found is that those that read the rude words took longer to make decisions, to record their decisions, and they made significantly more errors. 
This can be a big deal, especially when it comes to life-and-death situations. 
Steve, a physician, told me about a doctor that he worked with who was never very respectful, especially to junior staff and nurses. 
But Steve told me about this one particular interaction where this doctor shouted at a medical team. 
Right after the interaction, the team gave the wrong dosage of medication to their patient. 
Steve said the information was right there on the chart, but somehow everyone on the team missed it. 
He said they lacked the attention or awareness to take it into account. 
Simple mistake, right? 
Well, that patient died. 
Researchers in Israel have actually shown that medical teams exposed to rudeness perform worse not only in all their diagnostics, but in all the procedures they did. 
This was mainly because the teams exposed to rudeness didn't share information as readily, and they stopped seeking help from their teammates. 
And I see this not only in medicine but in all industries. 
So if incivility has such a huge cost, why do we still see so much of it? 
I was curious, so we surveyed people about this, too. 
The number one reason is stress. 
People feel overwhelmed. 
The other reason that people are not more civil is because they're skeptical and even concerned about being civil or appearing nice. 
They believe they'll appear less leader-like. 
They wonder: Do nice guys finish last? 
Or in other words: Do jerks get ahead? 
(Laughter) It's easy to think so, especially when we see a few prominent examples that dominate the conversation. 
Well, it turns out, in the long run, they don't. 
There's really rich research on this by Morgan McCall and Michael Lombardo when they were at the Center for Creative Leadership. 
They found that the number one reason tied to executive failure was an insensitive, abrasive or bullying style. 
There will always be some outliers that succeed despite their incivility. 
Sooner or later, though, most uncivil people sabotage their success. 
For example, with uncivil executives, it comes back to hurt them when they're in a place of weakness or they need something. 
People won't have their backs. 
But what about nice guys? 
Does civility pay? 
Yes, it does. 
And being civil doesn't just mean that you're not a jerk. 
Not holding someone down isn't the same as lifting them up. 
Being truly civil means doing the small things, like smiling and saying hello in the hallway, listening fully when someone's speaking to you. 
Now, you can have strong opinions, disagree, have conflict or give negative feedback civilly, with respect. 
Some people call it "radical candor," where you care personally, but you challenge directly. 
So yes, civility pays. 
In a biotechnology firm, colleagues and I found that those that were seen as civil were twice as likely to be viewed as leaders, and they performed significantly better. 
Why does civility pay? 
Because people see you as an important -- and a powerful -- unique combination of two key characteristics: warm and competent, friendly and smart. 
In other words, being civil isn't just about motivating others. 
It's about you. 
If you're civil, you're more likely to be seen as a leader. 
You'll perform better, and you're seen as warm and competent. 
But there's an even bigger story about how civility pays, and it ties to one of the most important questions around leadership: What do people want most from their leaders? 
We took data from over 20,000 employees around the world, and we found the answer was simple: respect. 
Being treated with respect was more important than recognition and appreciation, useful feedback, even opportunities for learning. 
Those that felt respected were healthier, more focused, more likely to stay with their organization and far more engaged. 
So where do you start? 
How can you lift people up and make people feel respected? 
Well, the nice thing is, it doesn't require a huge shift. 
Small things can make a big difference. 
I found that thanking people, sharing credit, listening attentively, humbly asking questions, acknowledging others and smiling has an impact. 
Patrick Quinlan, former CEO of Ochsner Health [System], told me about the effects of their 10-5 way, where if you're within 10 feet of someone, you make eye contact and smile, and if you're within five feet, you say hello. 
He explained that civility spread, patient satisfaction scores rose, as did patient referrals. 
Civility and respect can be used to boost an organization's performance. 
When my friend Doug Conant took over as CEO of Campbell's Soup Company in 2001, the company's market share had just dropped in half. 
Sales were declining, lots of people had just been laid off. 
A Gallup manager said it was the least engaged organization that they had surveyed. 
And as Doug drove up to work his first day, he noticed that the headquarters was surrounded by barbwire fence. 
There were guard towers in the parking lot. 
He said it looked like a minimum security prison. 
It felt toxic. 
Within five years, Doug had turned things around. 
And within nine years, they were setting all-time performance records and racking up awards, including best place to work. 
How did he do it? 
On day one, Doug told employees that he was going to have high standards for performance, but they were going to do it with civility. 
He walked the talk, and he expected his leaders to. 
For Doug, it all came down to being tough-minded on standards and tenderhearted with people. 
For him, he said it was all about these touch points, or these daily interactions he had with employees, whether in the hallway, in the cafeteria or in meetings. 
And if he handled each touch point well, he'd make employees feel valued. 
Another way that Doug made employees feel valued and showed them that he was paying attention is that he handwrote over 30,000 thank-you notes to employees. 
And this set an example for other leaders. 
Leaders have about 400 of these touch points a day. 
Most don't take long, less than two minutes each. 
The key is to be agile and mindful in each of these moments. 
Civility lifts people. 
We'll get people to give more and function at their best if we're civil. 
Incivility chips away at people and their performance. 
It robs people of their potential, even if they're just working around it. 
What I know from my research is that when we have more civil environments, we're more productive, creative, helpful, happy and healthy. 
We can do better. 
Each one of us can be more mindful and can take actions to lift others up around us, at work, at home, online, in schools and in our communities. 
In every interaction, think: Who do you want to be? 
Let's put an end to incivility bug and start spreading civility. 
After all, it pays. 
Thank you. 
(Applause) 

I was recently traveling in the Highlands of New Guinea, and I was talking with a man who had three wives. 
I asked him, "How many wives would you like to have?" 
And there was this long pause, and I thought to myself, "Is he going to say five? 
Is he going to say 10? 
Is he going to say 25?" 
And he leaned towards me and he whispered, "None." 
(Laughter) Eighty-six percent of human societies permit a man to have several wives: polygyny. 
But in the vast majority of these cultures, only about five or ten percent of men actually do have several wives. 
Having several partners can be a toothache. 
In fact, co-wives can fight with each other, sometimes they can even poison each other's children. 
And you've got to have a lot of cows, a lot of goats, a lot of money, a lot of land, in order to build a harem. 
We are a pair-bonding species. 
Ninety-seven percent of mammals do not pair up to rear their young; human beings do. 
I'm not suggesting that we're not -- that we're necessarily sexually faithful to our partners. 
I've looked at adultery in 42 cultures, I understand, actually, some of the genetics of it, and some of the brain circuitry of it. 
It's very common around the world, but we are built to love. 
How is technology changing love? 
I'm going to say almost not at all. 
I study the brain. 
I and my colleagues have put over 100 people into a brain scanner -- people who had just fallen happily in love, people who had just been rejected in love and people who are in love long-term. 
And it is possible to remain "in love" long-term. 
And I've long ago maintained that we've evolved three distinctly different brain systems for mating and reproduction: sex drive, feelings of intense romantic love and feelings of deep cosmic attachment to a long-term partner. 
And together, these three brain systems -- with many other parts of the brain -- orchestrate our sexual, our romantic and our family lives. 
But they lie way below the cortex, way below the limbic system where we feel our emotions, generate our emotions. 
They lie in the most primitive parts of the brain, linked with energy, focus, craving, motivation, wanting and drive. 
In this case, the drive to win life's greatest prize: a mating partner. 
They evolved over 4.4 million years ago among our first ancestors, and they're not going to change if you swipe left or right on Tinder. 
(Laughter) (Applause) There's no question that technology is changing the way we court: emailing, texting, emojis to express your emotions, sexting, "liking" a photograph, selfies ... 
We're seeing new rules and taboos for how to court. 
But, you know -- is this actually dramatically changing love? 
What about the late 1940s, when the automobile became very popular and we suddenly had rolling bedrooms? 
(Laughter) How about the introduction of the birth control pill? 
Unchained from the great threat of pregnancy and social ruin, women could finally express their primitive and primal sexuality. 
Even dating sites are not changing love. 
I'm Chief Scientific Advisor to Match.com, I've been it for 11 years. 
I keep telling them and they agree with me, that these are not dating sites, they are introducing sites. 
When you sit down in a bar, in a coffee house, on a park bench, your ancient brain snaps into action like a sleeping cat awakened, and you smile and laugh and listen and parade the way our ancestors did 100,000 years ago. 
We can give you various people -- all the dating sites can -- but the only real algorithm is your own human brain. 
Technology is not going to change that. 
Technology is also not going to change who you choose to love. 
I study the biology of personality, and I've come to believe that we've evolved four very broad styles of thinking and behaving, linked with the dopamine, serotonin, testosterone and estrogen systems. 
So I created a questionnaire directly from brain science to measure the degree to which you express the traits -- the constellation of traits -- linked with each of these four brain systems. 
I then put that questionnaire on various dating sites in 40 countries. 
Fourteen million or more people have now taken the questionnaire, and I've been able to watch who's naturally drawn to whom. 
And as it turns out, those who were very expressive of the dopamine system tend to be curious, creative, spontaneous, energetic -- I would imagine there's an awful lot of people like that in this room -- they're drawn to people like themselves. 
Curious, creative people need people like themselves. 
People who are very expressive of the serotonin system tend to be traditional, conventional, they follow the rules, they respect authority, they tend to be religious -- religiosity is in the serotonin system -- and traditional people go for traditional people. 
In that way, similarity attracts. 
In the other two cases, opposites attract. 
People very expressive of the testosterone system tend to be analytical, logical, direct, decisive, and they go for their opposite: they go for somebody who's high estrogen, somebody who's got very good verbal skills and people skills, who's very intuitive and who's very nurturing and emotionally expressive. 
We have natural patterns of mate choice. 
Modern technology is not going to change who we choose to love. 
But technology is producing one modern trend that I find particularly important. 
It's associated with the concept of paradox of choice. 
For millions of years, we lived in little hunting and gathering groups. 
You didn't have the opportunity to choose between 1,000 people on a dating site. 
In fact, I've been studying this recently, and I actually think there's some sort of sweet spot in the brain; I don't know what it is, but apparently, from reading a lot of the data, we can embrace about five to nine alternatives, and after that, you get into what academics call "cognitive overload," and you don't choose any. 
So I've come to think that due to this cognitive overload, we're ushering in a new form of courtship that I call "slow love." 
I arrived at this during my work with Match.com. 
Every year for the last six years, we've done a study called "Singles in America." 
We don't poll the Match population, we poll the American population. 
We use 5,000-plus people, a representative sample of Americans based on the US census. 
We've got data now on over 30,000 people, and every single year, I see some of the same patterns. 
Every single year when I ask the question, over 50 percent of people have had a one-night stand -- not necessarily last year, but in their lives -- 50 percent have had a friends with benefits during the course of their lives, and over 50 percent have lived with a person long-term before marrying. 
Americans think that this is reckless. 
I have doubted that for a long time; the patterns are too strong. 
There's got to be some Darwinian explanation -- Not that many people are crazy. 
And I stumbled, then, on a statistic that really came home to me. 
It was a very interesting academic article in which I found that 67 percent of singles in America today who are living long-term with somebody, have not yet married because they are terrified of divorce. 
They're terrified of the social, legal, emotional, economic consequences of divorce. 
So I came to realize that I don't think this is recklessness; I think it's caution. 
Today's singles want to know every single thing about a partner before they wed. 
You learn a lot between the sheets, not only about how somebody makes love, but whether they're kind, whether they can listen and at my age, whether they've got a sense of humor. 
(Laughter) And in an age where we have too many choices, we have very little fear of pregnancy and disease and we've got no feeling of shame for sex before marriage, I think people are taking their time to love. 
And actually, what's happening is, what we're seeing is a real expansion of the precommitment stage before you tie the knot. 
Where marriage used to be the beginning of a relationship, now it's the finale. 
But the human brain -- (Laughter) The human brain always triumphs, and indeed, in the United States today, 86 percent of Americans will marry by age 49. 
And even in cultures around the world where they're not marrying as often, they are settling down eventually with a long-term partner. 
So it began to occur to me: during this long extension of the precommitment stage, if you can get rid of bad relationships before you marry, maybe we're going to see more happy marriages. 
So I did a study of 1,100 married people in America -- not on Match.com, of course -- and I asked them a lot of questions. 
But one of the questions was, "Would you re-marry the person you're currently married to?" 
And 81 percent said, "Yes." 
In fact, the greatest change in modern romance and family life is not technology. 
It's not even slow love. 
It's actually women piling into the job market in cultures around the world. 
For millions of years, our ancestors lived in little hunting and gathering groups. 
Women commuted to work to gather their fruits and vegetables. 
They came home with 60 to 80 percent of the evening meal. 
The double-income family was the rule. 
And women were regarded as just as economically, socially and sexually powerful as men. 
Then the environment changed some 10,000 years ago, we began to settle down on the farm and both men and women became obliged, really, to marry the right person, from the right background, from the right religion and from the right kin and social and political connections. 
Men's jobs became more important: they had to move the rocks, fell the trees, plow the land. 
They brought the produce to local markets, and came home with the equivalent of money. 
Along with this, we see a rise of a host of beliefs: the belief of virginity at marriage, arranged marriages -- strictly arranged marriages -- the belief that the man is the head of the household, that the wife's place is in the home and most important, honor thy husband, and 'til death do us part. 
These are gone. 
They are going, and in many places, they are gone. 
We are right now in a marriage revolution. 
We are shedding 10,000 years of our farming tradition and moving forward towards egalitarian relationships between the sexes -- something I regard as highly compatible with the ancient human spirit. 
I'm not a Pollyanna; there's a great deal to cry about. 
I've studied divorce in 80 cultures, I've studied, as I say, adultery in many -- there's a whole pile of problems. 
As William Butler Yeats, the poet, once said, "Love is the crooked thing." 
I would add, "Nobody gets out alive." 
(Laughter) We all have problems. 
But in fact, I think the poet Randall Jarrell really sums it up best. 
He said, "The dark, uneasy world of family life -- where the greatest can fail, and the humblest succeed." 
But I will leave you with this: love and attachment will prevail, technology cannot change it. 
And I will conclude by saying any understanding of human relationships must take into account one the most powerful determinants of human behavior: the unquenchable, adaptable and primordial human drive to love. 
Thank you. 
(Applause) Kelly Stoetzel: Thank you so much for that, Helen. 
As you know, there's another speaker here with us that works in your same field. 
She comes at it from a different perspective. 
Esther Perel is a psychotherapist who works with couples. 
You study data, Esther studies the stories the couples tell her when they come to her for help. 
Let's have her join us on the stage. 
Esther? 
(Applause) So Esther, when you were watching Helen's talk, was there any part of it that resonated with you through the lens of your own work that you'd like to comment on? 
Esther Perel: It's interesting, because on the one hand, the need for love is ubiquitous and universal. 
But the way we love -- the meaning we make out of it -- the rules that govern our relationships, I think, are changing fundamentally. 
We come from a model that, until now, was primarily regulated around duty and obligation, the needs of the collective and loyalty. 
And we have shifted it to a model of free choice and individual rights, and self-fulfillment and happiness. 
And so, that was the first thing I thought, that the need doesn't change, but the context and the way we regulate these relationships changes a lot. 
On the paradox of choice -- you know, on the one hand we relish the novelty and the playfulness, I think, to be able to have so many options. 
And at the same time, as you talk about this cognitive overload, I see many, many people who ... 
who dread the uncertainty and self-doubt that comes with this massa of choice, creating a case of "FOMO" and then leading us -- FOMO, fear of missed opportunity, or fear of missing out -- it's like, "How do I know I have found 'the one' -- the right one?" 
So we've created what I call this thing of "stable ambiguity." 
Stable ambiguity is when you are too afraid to be alone but also not really willing to engage in intimacy-building. 
It's a set of tactics that kind of prolong the uncertainty of a relationship but also the uncertainty of the breakup. 
So, here on the internet you have three major ones. 
One is icing and simmering, which are great stalling tactics that offer a kind of holding pattern that emphasizes the undefined nature of a relationship but at the same time gives you enough of a comforting consistency and enough freedom of the undefined boundaries. 
(Laughter) Yeah? 
And then comes ghosting. 
And ghosting is, basically, you disappear from this massa of texts on the spot, and you don't have to deal with the pain that you inflict on another, because you're making it invisible even to yourself. 
(Laughter) Yeah? 
So I was thinking -- these words came up for me as I was listening to you, like how a vocabulary also creates a reality, and at the same time, that's my question to you: Do you think when the context changes, it still means that the nature of love remains the same? 
You study the brain and I study people's relationships and stories, so I think it's everything you say, plus. 
But I don't always know the degree to which a changing context ... 
Does it at some point begin to change -- If the meaning changes, does it change the need, or is the need clear of the entire context? 
HF: Wow! Well -- (Laughter) (Applause) Well, I've got three points here, right? 
First of all, to your first one: there's no question that we've changed, that we now want a person to love, and for thousands of years, we had to marry the right person from the right background and right kin connection. 
And in fact, in my studies of 5,000 people every year, I ask them, "What are you looking for?" 
And every single year, over 97 percent say -- EP: The list grows -- HF: Well, no. 
The basic thing is over 97 percent of people want somebody that respects them, somebody they can trust and confide in, somebody who makes them laugh, somebody who makes enough time for them and somebody who they find physically attractive. 
That never changes. 
And there's certainly -- you know, there's two parts -- EP: But you know how I call that? 
That's not what people used to say -- HF: That's exactly right. 
EP: They said they wanted somebody with whom they have companionship, economic support, children. 
We went from a production economy to a service economy. 
(Laughter) We did it in the larger culture, and we're doing it in marriage. 
HF: Right, no question about it. 
But it's interesting, the millennials actually want to be very good parents, whereas the generation above them wants to have a very fine marriage but is not as focused on being a good parent. 
You see all of these nuances. 
There's two basic parts of personality: there's your culture -- everything you grew up to do and believe and say -- and there's your temperament. 
Basically, what I've been talking about is your temperament. 
And that temperament is certainly going to change with changing times and changing beliefs. 
And in terms of the paradox of choice, there's no question about it that this is a pickle. 
There were millions of years where you found that sweet boy at the other side of the water hole, and you went for it. 
EP: Yes, but you -- HF: I do want to say one more thing. 
The bottom line is, in hunting and gathering societies, they tended to have two or three partners during the course of their lives. 
They weren't square! 
And I'm not suggesting that we do, but the bottom line is, we've always had alternatives. 
Mankind is always -- in fact, the brain is well-built to what we call "equilibrate," to try and decide: Do I come, do I stay? Do I go, do I stay? 
What are the opportunities here? 
How do I handle this there? 
And so I think we're seeing another play-out of that now. 
KS: Well, thank you both so much. 
I think you're going to have a million dinner partners for tonight! 
(Applause) Thank you, thank you. 

Speaking up is hard to do. 
I understood the true meaning of this phrase exactly one month ago, when my wife and I became new parents. 
It was an amazing moment. 
It was exhilarating and elating, but it was also scary and terrifying. 
And it got particularly terrifying when we got home from the hospital, and we were unsure whether our little baby boy was getting enough nutrients from breastfeeding. 
And we wanted to call our pediatrician, but we also didn't want to make a bad first impression or come across as a crazy, neurotic parent. 
So we worried. 
And we waited. 
When we got to the doctor's office the next day, she immediately gave him formula because he was pretty dehydrated. 
Our son is fine now, and our doctor has reassured us we can always contact her. 
But in that moment, I should've spoken up, but I didn't. 
But sometimes we speak up when we shouldn't, and I learned that over 10 years ago when I let my twin brother down. 
My twin brother is a documentary filmmaker, and for one of his first films, he got an offer from a distribution company. 
He was excited, and he was inclined to accept the offer. 
But as a negotiations researcher, I insisted he make a counteroffer, and I helped him craft the perfect one. 
And it was perfect -- it was perfectly insulting. 
The company was so offended, they literally withdrew the offer and my brother was left with nothing. 
And I've asked people all over the world about this dilemma of speaking up: when they can assert themselves, when they can push their interests, when they can express an opinion, when they can make an ambitious ask. 
And the range of stories are varied and diverse, but they also make up a universal tapestry. 
Can I correct my boss when they make a mistake? 
Can I confront my coworker who keeps stepping on my toes? 
Can I challenge my friend's insensitive joke? 
Can I tell the person I love the most my deepest insecurities? 
And through these experiences, I've come to recognize that each of us have something called a range of acceptable behavior. 
Now, sometimes we're too strong; we push ourselves too much. 
That's what happened with my brother. 
Even making an offer was outside his range of acceptable behavior. 
But sometimes we're too weak. 
That's what happened with my wife and I. 
And this range of acceptable behaviors -- when we stay within our range, we're rewarded. 
When we step outside that range, we get punished in a variety of ways. 
We get dismissed or demeaned or even ostracized. 
Or we lose that raise or that promotion or that deal. 
Now, the first thing we need to know is: What is my range? 
But the key thing is, our range isn't fixed; it's actually pretty dynamic. 
It expands and it narrows based on the context. 
And there's one thing that determines that range more than anything else, and that's your power. 
Your power determines your range. 
What is power? 
Power comes in lots of forms. 
In negotiations, it comes in the form of alternatives. 
So my brother had no alternatives; he lacked power. 
The company had lots of alternatives; they had power. 
Sometimes it's being new to a country, like an immigrant, or new to an organization or new to an experience, like my wife and I as new parents. 
Sometimes it's at work, where someone's the boss and someone's the subordinate. 
Sometimes it's in relationships, where one person's more invested than the other person. 
And the key thing is that when we have lots of power, our range is very wide. 
We have a lot of leeway in how to behave. 
But when we lack power, our range narrows. 
We have very little leeway. 
The problem is that when our range narrows, that produces something called the low-power double bind. 
The low-power double bind happens when, if we don't speak up, we go unnoticed, but if we do speak up, we get punished. 
Now, many of you have heard the phrase the "double bind" and connected it with one thing, and that's gender. 
The gender double bind is women who don't speak up go unnoticed, and women who do speak up get punished. 
And the key thing is that women have the same need as men to speak up, but they have barriers to doing so. 
But what my research has shown over the last two decades is that what looks like a gender difference is not really a gender double bind, it's a really a low-power double bind. 
And what looks like a gender difference are really often just power differences in disguise. 
Oftentimes we see a difference between a man and a woman or men and women, and think, "Biological cause. There's something fundamentally different about the sexes." 
But in study after study, I've found that a better explanation for many sex differences is really power. 
And so it's the low-power double bind. 
And the low-power double bind means that we have a narrow range, and we lack power. 
We have a narrow range, and our double bind is very large. 
So we need to find ways to expand our range. 
And over the last couple decades, my colleagues and I have found two things really matter. 
The first: you seem powerful in your own eyes. 
The second: you seem powerful in the eyes of others. 
When I feel powerful, I feel confident, not fearful; I expand my own range. 
When other people see me as powerful, they grant me a wider range. 
So we need tools to expand our range of acceptable behavior. 
And I'm going to give you a set of tools today. 
Speaking up is risky, but these tools will lower your risk of speaking up. 
The first tool I'm going to give you got discovered in negotiations in an important finding. 
On average, women make less ambitious offers and get worse outcomes than men at the bargaining table. 
But Hannah Riley Bowles and Emily Amanatullah have discovered there's one situation where women get the same outcomes as men and are just as ambitious. 
That's when they advocate for others. 
When they advocate for others, they discover their own range and expand it in their own mind. 
They become more assertive. 
This is sometimes called "the mama bear effect." 
Like a mama bear defending her cubs, when we advocate for others, we can discover our own voice. 
But sometimes, we have to advocate for ourselves. 
How do we do that? 
One of the most important tools we have to advocate for ourselves is something called perspective-taking. 
And perspective-taking is really simple: it's simply looking at the world through the eyes of another person. 
It's one of the most important tools we have to expand our range. 
When I take your perspective, and I think about what you really want, you're more likely to give me what I really want. 
But here's the problem: perspective-taking is hard to do. 
So let's do a little experiment. 
I want you all to hold your hand just like this: your finger -- put it up. 
And I want you to draw a capital letter E on your forehead as quickly as possible. 
OK, it turns out that we can draw this E in one of two ways, and this was originally designed as a test of perspective-taking. 
I'm going to show you two pictures of someone with an E on their forehead -- my former student, Erika Hall. 
And you can see over here, that's the correct E. 
I drew the E so it looks like an E to another person. 
That's the perspective-taking E because it looks like an E from someone else's vantage point. 
But this E over here is the self-focused E. 
We often get self-focused. 
And we particularly get self-focused in a crisis. 
I want to tell you about a particular crisis. 
A man walks into a bank in Watsonville, California. 
And he says, "Give me $2,000, or I'm blowing the whole bank up with a bomb." 
Now, the bank manager didn't give him the money. 
She took a step back. 
She took his perspective, and she noticed something really important. 
He asked for a specific amount of money. 
So she said, "Why did you ask for $2,000?" 
And he said, "My friend is going to be evicted unless I get him $2,000 immediately." 
And she said, "Oh! You don't want to rob the bank -- you want to take out a loan." 
(Laughter) "Why don't you come back to my office, and we can have you fill out the paperwork." 
(Laughter) Now, her quick perspective-taking defused a volatile situation. 
So when we take someone's perspective, it allows us to be ambitious and assertive, but still be likable. 
Here's another way to be assertive but still be likable, and that is to signal flexibility. 
Now, imagine you're a car salesperson, and you want to sell someone a car. 
You're going to more likely make the sale if you give them two options. 
Let's say option A: $24,000 for this car and a five-year warranty. 
Or option B: $23,000 and a three-year warranty. 
My research shows that when you give people a choice among options, it lowers their defenses, and they're more likely to accept your offer. 
And this doesn't just work with salespeople; it works with parents. 
When my niece was four, she resisted getting dressed and rejected everything. 
But then my sister-in-law had a brilliant idea. 
What if I gave my daughter a choice? 
This shirt or that shirt? OK, that shirt. 
This pant or that pant? OK, that pant. 
And it worked brilliantly. 
She got dressed quickly and without resistance. 
When I've asked the question around the world when people feel comfortable speaking up, the number one answer is: "When I have social support in my audience; when I have allies." 
So we want to get allies on our side. 
How do we do that? 
Well, one of the ways is be a mama bear. 
When we advocate for others, we expand our range in our own eyes and the eyes of others, but we also earn strong allies. 
Another way we can earn strong allies, especially in high places, is by asking other people for advice. 
When we ask others for advice, they like us because we flatter them, and we're expressing humility. 
And this really works to solve another double bind. 
And that's the self-promotion double bind. 
The self-promotion double bind is that if we don't advertise our accomplishments, no one notices. 
And if we do, we're not likable. 
But if we ask for advice about one of our accomplishments, we are able to be competent in their eyes but also be likeable. 
And this is so powerful it even works when you see it coming. 
There have been multiple times in life when I have been forewarned that a low-power person has been given the advice to come ask me for advice. 
I want you to notice three things about this: First, I knew they were going to come ask me for advice. 
Two, I've actually done research on the strategic benefits of asking for advice. 
And three, it still worked! 
I took their perspective, I became more invested in their cause, I became more committed to them because they asked for advice. 
Now, another time we feel more confident speaking up is when we have expertise. 
Expertise gives us credibility. 
When we have high power, we already have credibility. 
We only need good evidence. 
When we lack power, we don't have the credibility. 
We need excellent evidence. 
And one of the ways we can come across as an expert is by tapping into our passion. 
I want everyone in the next few days to go up to friend of theirs and just say to them, "I want you to describe a passion of yours to me." 
I've had people do this all over the world and I asked them, "What did you notice about the other person when they described their passion?" 
And the answers are always the same. 
"Their eyes lit up and got big." 
"They smiled a big beaming smile." 
"They used their hands all over -- I had to duck because their hands were coming at me." 
"They talk quickly with a little higher pitch." 
(Laughter) "They leaned in as if telling me a secret." 
And then I said to them, "What happened to you as you listened to their passion?" 
They said, "My eyes lit up. 
I smiled. 
I leaned in." 
When we tap into our passion, we give ourselves the courage, in our own eyes, to speak up, but we also get the permission from others to speak up. 
Tapping into our passion even works when we come across as too weak. 
Both men and women get punished at work when they shed tears. 
But Lizzie Wolf has shown that when we frame our strong emotions as passion, the condemnation of our crying disappears for both men and women. 
I want to end with a few words from my late father that he spoke at my twin brother's wedding. 
Here's a picture of us. 
My dad was a psychologist like me, but his real love and his real passion was cinema, like my brother. 
And so he wrote a speech for my brother's wedding about the roles we play in the human comedy. 
And he said, "The lighter your touch, the better you become at improving and enriching your performance. 
Those who embrace their roles and work to improve their performance grow, change and expand the self. 
Play it well, and your days will be mostly joyful." 
What my dad was saying is that we've all been assigned ranges and roles in this world. 
But he was also saying the essence of this talk: those roles and ranges are constantly expanding and evolving. 
So when a scene calls for it, be a ferocious mama bear and a humble advice seeker. 
Have excellent evidence and strong allies. 
Be a passionate perspective taker. 
And if you use those tools -- and each and every one of you can use these tools -- you will expand your range of acceptable behavior, and your days will be mostly joyful. 
Thank you. 
(Applause) 

When I was six years old, I received my gifts. 
My first grade teacher had this brilliant idea. 
She wanted us to experience receiving gifts but also learning the virtue of complimenting each other. 
So she had all of us come to the front of the classroom, and she bought all of us gifts and stacked them in the corner. 
And she said, "Why don't we just stand here and compliment each other? 
If you hear your name called, go and pick up your gift and sit down." 
What a wonderful idea, right? 
What could go wrong? 
(Laughter) Well, there were 40 of us to start with, and every time I heard someone's name called, I would give out the heartiest cheer. 
And then there were 20 people left, and 10 people left, and five left ... 
and three left. 
And I was one of them. 
And the compliments stopped. 
Well, at that moment, I was crying. 
And the teacher was freaking out. 
She was like, "Hey, would anyone say anything nice about these people?" 
(Laughter) "No one? OK, why don't you go get your gift and sit down. 
So behave next year -- someone might say something nice about you." 
(Laughter) Well, as I'm describing this you, you probably know I remember this really well. 
(Laughter) But I don't know who felt worse that day. 
Was it me or the teacher? 
She must have realized that she turned a team-building event into a public roast for three six-year-olds. 
And without the humor. 
You know, when you see people get roasted on TV, it was funny. 
There was nothing funny about that day. 
So that was one version of me, and I would die to avoid being in that situation again -- to get rejected in public again. 
That's one version. 
Then fast-forward eight years. 
Bill Gates came to my hometown -- Beijing, China -- to speak, and I saw his message. 
I fell in love with that guy. 
I thought, wow, I know what I want to do now. 
That night I wrote a letter to my family telling them: "By age 25, I will build the biggest company in the world, and that company will buy Microsoft." 
(Laughter) I totally embraced this idea of conquering the world -- domination, right? 
And I didn't make this up, I did write that letter. 
And here it is -- (Laughter) You don't have to read this through -- (Laughter) This is also bad handwriting, but I did highlight some key words. 
You get the idea. 
(Laughter) So ... 
that was another version of me: one who will conquer the world. 
Well, then two years later, I was presented with the opportunity to come to the United States. 
I jumped on it, because that was where Bill Gates lived, right? 
(Laughter) I thought that was the start of my entrepreneur journey. 
Then, fast-forward another 14 years. 
I was 30. 
Nope, I didn't build that company. 
I didn't even start. 
I was actually a marketing manager for a Fortune 500 company. 
And I felt I was stuck; I was stagnant. 
Why is that? 
Where is that 14-year-old who wrote that letter? 
It's not because he didn't try. 
It's because every time I had a new idea, every time I wanted to try something new, even at work -- I wanted to make a proposal, I wanted to speak up in front of people in a group -- I felt there was this constant battle between the 14-year-old and the six-year-old. 
One wanted to conquer the world -- make a difference -- another was afraid of rejection. 
And every time that six-year-old won. 
And this fear even persisted after I started my own company. 
I mean, I started my own company when I was 30 -- if you want to be Bill Gates, you've got to start sooner or later, right? 
When I was an entrepreneur, I was presented with an investment opportunity, and then I was turned down. 
And that rejection hurt me. 
It hurt me so bad that I wanted to quit right there. 
But then I thought, hey, would Bill Gates quit after a simple investment rejection? 
Would any successful entrepreneur quit like that? 
No way. 
And this is where it clicked for me. 
OK, I can build a better company. 
I can build a better team or better product, but one thing for sure: I've got to be a better leader. 
I've got to be a better person. 
I cannot let that six-year-old keep dictating my life anymore. 
I have to put him back in his place. 
So this is where I went online and looked for help. 
Google was my friend. 
(Laughter) I searched, "How do I overcome the fear of rejection?" 
I came up with a bunch of psychology articles about where the fear and pain are coming from. 
Then I came up with a bunch of "rah-rah" inspirational articles about "Don't take it personally, just overcome it." 
Who doesn't know that? 
(Laughter) But why was I still so scared? 
Then I found this website by luck. 
It's called rejectiontherapy.com. 
(Laughter) "Rejection Therapy" was this game invented by this Canadian entrepreneur. 
His name is Jason Comely. 
And basically the idea is for 30 days you go out and look for rejection, and every day get rejected at something, and then by the end, you desensitize yourself from the pain. 
And I loved that idea. 
(Laughter) I said, "You know what? I'm going to do this. 
And I'll feel myself getting rejected 100 days." 
And I came up with my own rejection ideas, and I made a video blog out of it. 
And so here's what I did. 
This is what the blog looked like. 
Day One ... 
(Laughter) Borrow 100 dollars from a stranger. 
So this is where I went to where I was working. 
I came downstairs and I saw this big guy sitting behind a desk. 
He looked like a security guard. 
So I just approached him. 
And I was just walking and that was the longest walk of my life -- hair on the back of my neck standing up, I was sweating and my heart was pounding. 
And I got there and said, "Hey, sir, can I borrow 100 dollars from you?" 
(Laughter) And he looked up, he's like, "No." 
"Why?" 
And I just said, "No? I'm sorry." 
Then I turned around, and I just ran. 
(Laughter) I felt so embarrassed. 
But because I filmed myself -- so that night I was watching myself getting rejected, I just saw how scared I was. 
I looked like this kid in "The Sixth Sense." 
I saw dead people. 
(Laughter) But then I saw this guy. 
You know, he wasn't that menacing. 
He was a chubby, loveable guy, and he even asked me, "Why?" 
In fact, he invited me to explain myself. 
And I could've said many things. 
I could've explained, I could've negotiated. 
I didn't do any of that. 
All I did was run. 
I felt, wow, this is like a microcosm of my life. 
Every time I felt the slightest rejection, I would just run as fast as I could. 
And you know what? 
The next day, no matter what happens, I'm not going to run. 
I'll stay engaged. 
Day Two: Request a "burger refill." 
(Laughter) It's when I went to a burger joint, I finished lunch, and I went to the cashier and said, "Hi, can I get a burger refill?" 
(Laughter) He was all confused, like, "What's a burger refill?" 
(Laughter) I said, "Well, it's just like a drink refill but with a burger." 
And he said, "Sorry, we don't do burger refill, man." 
(Laughter) So this is where rejection happened and I could have run, but I stayed. 
I said, "Well, I love your burgers, I love your joint, and if you guys do a burger refill, I will love you guys more." 
(Laughter) And he said, "Well, OK, I'll tell my manager about it, and maybe we'll do it, but sorry, we can't do this today." 
Then I left. 
And by the way, I don't think they've ever done burger refill. 
(Laughter) I think they're still there. 
But the life and death feeling I was feeling the first time was no longer there, just because I stayed engaged -- because I didn't run. 
I said, "Wow, great, I'm already learning things. 
Great." 
And then Day Three: Getting Olympic Doughnuts. 
This is where my life was turned upside down. 
I went to a Krispy Kreme. 
It's a doughnut shop in mainly the Southeastern part of the United States. 
I'm sure they have some here, too. 
And I went in, I said, "Can you make me doughnuts that look like Olympic symbols? 
Basically, you interlink five doughnuts together ... " I mean there's no way they could say yes, right? 
The doughnut maker took me so seriously. 
(Laughter) So she put out paper, started jotting down the colors and the rings, and is like, "How can I make this?" 
And then 15 minutes later, she came out with a box that looked like Olympic rings. 
And I was so touched. 
I just couldn't believe it. 
And that video got over five million views on Youtube. 
The world couldn't believe that either. 
(Laughter) You know, because of that I was in newspapers, in talk shows, in everything. 
And I became famous. 
A lot of people started writing emails to me and saying, "What you're doing is awesome." 
But you know, fame and notoriety did not do anything to me. 
What I really wanted to do was learn, and to change myself. 
So I turned the rest of my 100 days of rejection into this playground -- into this research project. 
I wanted to see what I could learn. 
And then I learned a lot of things. 
I discovered so many secrets. 
For example, I found if I just don't run, if I got rejected, I could actually turn a "no" into a "yes," and the magic word is, "why." 
So one day I went to a stranger's house, I had this flower in my hand, knocked on the door and said, "Hey, can I plant this flower in your backyard?" 
(Laughter) And he said, "No." 
But before he could leave I said, "Hey, can I know why?" 
And he said, "Well, I have this dog that would dig up anything I put in the backyard. 
I don't want to waste your flower. 
If you want to do this, go across the street and talk to Connie. 
She loves flowers." 
So that's what I did. 
I went across and knocked on Connie's door. 
And she was so happy to see me. 
(Laughter) And then half an hour later, there was this flower in Connie's backyard. 
I'm sure it looks better now. 
(Laughter) But had I left after the initial rejection, I would've thought, well, it's because the guy didn't trust me, it's because I was crazy, because I didn't dress up well, I didn't look good. 
It was none of those. 
It was because what I offered did not fit what he wanted. 
And he trusted me enough to offer me a referral, using a sales term. 
I converted a referral. 
Then one day -- and I also learned that I can actually say certain things and maximize my chance to get a yes. 
So for example, one day I went to a Starbucks, and asked the manager, "Hey, can I be a Starbucks greeter?" 
He was like, "What's a Starbucks greeter?" 
I said, "Do you know those Walmart greeters? 
You know, those people who say 'hi' to you before you walk in the store, and make sure you don't steal stuff, basically? 
I want to give a Walmart experience to Starbucks customers." 
(Laughter) Well, I'm not sure that's a good thing, actually -- Actually, I'm pretty sure it's a bad thing. 
And he was like, "Oh" -- yeah, this is how he looked, his name is Eric -- and he was like, "I'm not sure." 
This is how he was hearing me. "Not sure." 
Then I ask him, "Is that weird?" 
He's like, "Yeah, it's really weird, man." 
But as soon as he said that, his whole demeanor changed. 
It's as if he's putting all the doubt on the floor. 
And he said, "Yeah, you can do this, just don't get too weird." 
(Laughter) So for the next hour I was the Starbucks greeter. 
I said "hi" to every customer that walked in, and gave them holiday cheers. 
By the way, I don't know what your career trajectory is, don't be a greeter. 
(Laughter) It was really boring. 
But then I found I could do this because I mentioned, "Is that weird?" 
I mentioned the doubt that he was having. 
And because I mentioned, "Is that weird?", that means I wasn't weird. 
That means I was actually thinking just like him, seeing this as a weird thing. 
And again, and again, I learned that if I mention some doubt people might have before I ask the question, I gained their trust. 
People were more likely to say yes to me. 
And then I learned I could fulfill my life dream ... 
by asking. 
You know, I came from four generations of teachers, and my grandma has always told me, "Hey Jia, you can do anything you want, but it'd be great if you became a teacher." 
(Laughter) But I wanted to be an entrepreneur, so I didn't. 
But it has always been my dream to actually teach something. 
So I said, "What if I just ask and teach a college class?" 
I lived in Austin at the time, so I went to University of Texas at Austin and knocked on professors' doors and said, "Can I teach your class?" 
I didn't get anywhere the first couple of times. 
But because I didn't run -- I kept doing it -- and on the third try the professor was very impressed. 
He was like, "No one has done this before." 
And I came in prepared with powerpoints and my lesson. 
He said, "Wow, I can use this. 
Why don't you come back in two months? I'll fit you in my curriculum." 
And two months later I was teaching a class. 
This is me -- you probably can't see, this is a bad picture. 
You know, sometimes you get rejected by lighting, you know? 
(Laughter) But wow -- when I finished teaching that class, I walked out crying, because I thought I could fulfill my life dream just by simply asking. 
I used to think I have to accomplish all these things -- have to be a great entrepreneur, or get a PhD to teach -- but no, I just asked, and I could teach. 
And in that picture, which you can't see, I quoted Martin Luther King, Jr. 
Why? Because in my research I found that people who really change the world, who change the way we live and the way we think, are the people who were met with initial and often violent rejections. 
People like Martin Luther King, Jr., like Mahatma Gandhi, Nelson Mandela, or even Jesus Christ. 
These people did not let rejection define them. 
They let their own reaction after rejection define themselves. 
And they embraced rejection. 
And we don't have to be those people to learn about rejection, and in my case, rejection was my curse, was my boogeyman. 
It has bothered me my whole life because I was running away from it. 
Then I started embracing it. 
I turned that into the biggest gift in my life. 
I started teaching people how to turn rejections into opportunities. 
I use my blog, I use my talk, I use the book I just published, and I'm even building technology to help people overcome their fear of rejection. 
When you get rejected in life, when you are facing the next obstacle or next failure, consider the possibilities. 
Don't run. 
If you just embrace them, they might become your gifts as well. 
Thank you. 
(Applause) 

There is something about physics that has been really bothering me since I was a little kid. 
And it's related to a question that scientists have been asking for almost 100 years, with no answer. 
How do the smallest things in nature, the particles of the quantum world, match up with the largest things in nature -- planets and stars and galaxies held together by gravity? 
As a kid, I would puzzle over questions just like this. 
I would fiddle around with microscopes and electromagnets, and I would read about the forces of the small and about quantum mechanics and I would marvel at how well that description matched up to our observation. 
Then I would look at the stars, and I would read about how well we understand gravity, and I would think surely, there must be some elegant way that these two systems match up. 
But there's not. 
And the books would say, yeah, we understand a lot about these two realms separately, but when we try to link them mathematically, everything breaks. 
And for 100 years, none of our ideas as to how to solve this basically physics disaster, has ever been supported by evidence. 
And to little old me -- little, curious, skeptical James -- this was a supremely unsatisfying answer. 
So, I'm still a skeptical little kid. 
Flash-forward now to December of 2015, when I found myself smack in the middle of the physics world being flipped on its head. 
It all started when we at CERN saw something intriguing in our data: a hint of a new particle, an inkling of a possibly extraordinary answer to this question. 
So I'm still a skeptical little kid, I think, but I'm also now a particle hunter. 
I am a physicist at CERN's Large Hadron Collider, the largest science experiment ever mounted. 
It's a 27-kilometer tunnel on the border of France and Switzerland buried 100 meters underground. 
And in this tunnel, we use superconducting magnets colder than outer space to accelerate protons to almost the speed of light and slam them into each other millions of times per second, collecting the debris of these collisions to search for new, undiscovered fundamental particles. 
Its design and construction took decades of work by thousands of physicists from around the globe, and in the summer of 2015, we had been working tirelessly to switch on the LHC at the highest energy that humans have ever used in a collider experiment. 
Now, higher energy is important because for particles, there is an equivalence between energy and particle mass, and mass is just a number put there by nature. 
To discover new particles, we need to reach these bigger numbers. 
And to do that, we have to build a bigger, higher energy collider, and the biggest, highest energy collider in the world is the Large Hadron Collider. 
And then, we collide protons quadrillions of times, and we collect this data very slowly, over months and months. 
And then new particles might show up in our data as bumps -- slight deviations from what you expect, little clusters of data points that make a smooth line not so smooth. 
For example, this bump, after months of data-taking in 2012, led to the discovery of the Higgs particle -- the Higgs boson -- and to a Nobel Prize for the confirmation of its existence. 
This jump up in energy in 2015 represented the best chance that we as a species had ever had of discovering new particles -- new answers to these long-standing questions, because it was almost twice as much energy as we used when we discovered the Higgs boson. 
Many of my colleagues had been working their entire careers for this moment, and frankly, to little curious me, this was the moment I'd been waiting for my entire life. 
So 2015 was go time. 
So June 2015, the LHC is switched back on. 
My colleagues and I held our breath and bit our fingernails, and then finally we saw the first proton collisions at this highest energy ever. 
Applause, champagne, celebration. 
This was a milestone for science, and we had no idea what we would find in this brand-new data. 
And then a few weeks later, we found a bump. 
It wasn't a very big bump, but it was big enough to make you raise your eyebrow. 
But on a scale of one to 10 for eyebrow raises, if 10 indicates that you've discovered a new particle, this eyebrow raise is about a four. 
(Laughter) I spent hours, days, weeks in secret meetings, arguing with my colleagues over this little bump, poking and prodding it with our most ruthless experimental sticks to see if it would withstand scrutiny. 
But even after months of working feverishly -- sleeping in our offices and not going home, candy bars for dinner, coffee by the bucketful -- physicists are machines for turning coffee into diagrams -- (Laughter) This little bump would not go away. 
So after a few months, we presented our little bump to the world with a very clear message: this little bump is interesting but it's not definitive, so let's keep an eye on it as we take more data. 
So we were trying to be extremely cool about it. 
And the world ran with it anyway. 
The news loved it. 
People said it reminded them of the little bump that was shown on the way toward the Higgs boson discovery. 
Better than that, my theorist colleagues -- I love my theorist colleagues -- my theorist colleagues wrote 500 papers about this little bump. 
(Laughter) The world of particle physics had been flipped on its head. 
But what was it about this particular bump that caused thousands of physicists to collectively lose their cool? 
This little bump was unique. 
This little bump indicated that we were seeing an unexpectedly large number of collisions whose debris consisted of only two photons, two particles of light. 
And that's rare. 
Particle collisions are not like automobile collisions. 
They have different rules. 
When two particles collide at almost the speed of light, the quantum world takes over. 
And in the quantum world, these two particles can briefly create a new particle that lives for a tiny fraction of a second before splitting into other particles that hit our detector. 
Imagine a car collision where the two cars vanish upon impact, a bicycle appears in their place -- (Laughter) And then that bicycle explodes into two skateboards, which hit our detector. 
(Laughter) Hopefully, not literally. 
They're very expensive. 
Events where only two photons hit out detector are very rare. 
And because of the special quantum properties of photons, there's a very small number of possible new particles -- these mythical bicycles -- that can give birth to only two photons. 
But one of these options is huge, and it has to do with that long-standing question that bothered me as a tiny little kid, about gravity. 
Gravity may seem super strong to you, but it's actually crazily weak compared to the other forces of nature. 
I can briefly beat gravity when I jump, but I can't pick a proton out of my hand. 
The strength of gravity compared to the other forces of nature? 
It's 10 to the minus 39. 
That's a decimal with 39 zeros after it. 
Worse than that, all of the other known forces of nature are perfectly described by this thing we call the Standard Model, which is our current best description of nature at its smallest scales, and quite frankly, one of the most successful achievements of humankind -- except for gravity, which is absent from the Standard Model. 
It's crazy. 
It's almost as though most of gravity has gone missing. 
We feel a little bit of it, but where's the rest of it? 
No one knows. 
But one theoretical explanation proposes a wild solution. 
You and I -- even you in the back -- we live in three dimensions of space. 
I hope that's a non-controversial statement. 
(Laughter) All of the known particles also live in three dimensions of space. 
In fact, a particle is just another name for an excitation in a three-dimensional field; a localized wobbling in space. 
More importantly, all the math that we use to describe all this stuff assumes that there are only three dimensions of space. 
But math is math, and we can play around with our math however we want. 
And people have been playing around with extra dimensions of space for a very long time, but it's always been an abstract mathematical concept. 
I mean, just look around you -- you at the back, look around -- there's clearly only three dimensions of space. 
But what if that's not true? 
What if the missing gravity is leaking into an extra-spatial dimension that's invisible to you and I? 
What if gravity is just as strong as the other forces if you were to view it in this extra-spatial dimension, and what you and I experience is a tiny slice of gravity make it seem very weak? 
If this were true, we would have to expand our Standard Model of particles to include an extra particle, a hyperdimensional particle of gravity, a special graviton that lives in extra-spatial dimensions. 
I see the looks on your faces. 
You should be asking me the question, "How in the world are we going to test this crazy, science fiction idea, stuck as we are in three dimensions?" 
The way we always do, by slamming together two protons -- (Laughter) Hard enough that the collision reverberates into any extra-spatial dimensions that might be there, momentarily creating this hyperdimensional graviton that then snaps back into the three dimensions of the LHC and spits off two photons, two particles of light. 
And this hypothetical, extra-dimensional graviton is one of the only possible, hypothetical new particles that has the special quantum properties that could give birth to our little, two-photon bump. 
So, the possibility of explaining the mysteries of gravity and of discovering extra dimensions of space -- perhaps now you get a sense as to why thousands of physics geeks collectively lost their cool over our little, two-photon bump. 
A discovery of this type would rewrite the textbooks. 
But remember, the message from us experimentalists that actually were doing this work at the time, was very clear: we need more data. 
With more data, the little bump will either turn into a nice, crisp Nobel Prize -- (Laughter) Or the extra data will fill in the space around the bump and turn it into a nice, smooth line. 
So we took more data, and with five times the data, several months later, our little bump turned into a smooth line. 
The news reported on a "huge disappointment," on "faded hopes," and on particle physicists "being sad." 
Given the tone of the coverage, you'd think that we had decided to shut down the LHC and go home. 
(Laughter) But that's not what we did. 
But why not? 
I mean, if I didn't discover a particle -- and I didn't -- if I didn't discover a particle, why am I here talking to you? 
Why didn't I just hang my head in shame and go home? 
Particle physicists are explorers. 
And very much of what we do is cartography. 
Let me put it this way: forget about the LHC for a second. 
Imagine you are a space explorer arriving at a distant planet, searching for aliens. 
What is your first task? 
To immediately orbit the planet, land, take a quick look around for any big, obvious signs of life, and report back to home base. 
That's the stage we're at now. 
We took a first look at the LHC for any new, big, obvious-to-spot particles, and we can report that there are none. 
We saw a weird-looking alien bump on a distant mountain, but once we got closer, we saw it was a rock. 
But then what do we do? Do we just give up and fly away? 
Absolutely not; we would be terrible scientists if we did. 
No, we spend the next couple of decades exploring, mapping out the territory, sifting through the sand with a fine instrument, peeking under every stone, drilling under the surface. 
New particles can either show up immediately as big, obvious-to-spot bumps, or they can only reveal themselves after years of data taking. 
Humanity has just begun its exploration at the LHC at this big high energy, and we have much searching to do. 
But what if, even after 10 or 20 years, we still find no new particles? 
We build a bigger machine. 
(Laughter) We search at higher energies. 
We search at higher energies. 
Planning is already underway for a 100-kilometer tunnel that will collide particles at 10 times the energy of the LHC. 
We don't decide where nature places new particles. 
We only decide to keep exploring. 
But what if, even after a 100-kilometer tunnel or a 500-kilometer tunnel or a 10,000-kilometer collider floating in space between the Earth and the Moon, we still find no new particles? 
Then perhaps we're doing particle physics wrong. 
(Laughter) Perhaps we need to rethink things. 
Maybe we need more resources, technology, expertise than what we currently have. 
We already use artificial intelligence and machine learning techniques in parts of the LHC, but imagine designing a particle physics experiment using such sophisticated algorithms that it could teach itself to discover a hyperdimensional graviton. 
But what if? 
What if the ultimate question: What if even artificial intelligence can't help us answer our questions? 
What if these open questions, for centuries, are destined to be unanswered for the foreseeable future? 
What if the stuff that's bothered me since I was a little kid is destined to be unanswered in my lifetime? 
Then that ... 
will be even more fascinating. 
We will be forced to think in completely new ways. 
We'll have to go back to our assumptions, and determine if there was a flaw somewhere. 
And we'll need to encourage more people to join us in studying science since we need fresh eyes on these century-old problems. 
I don't have the answers, and I'm still searching for them. 
But someone -- maybe she's in school right now, maybe she's not even born yet -- could eventually guide us to see physics in a completely new way, and to point out that perhaps we're just asking the wrong questions. 
Which would not be the end of physics, but a novel beginning. 
Thank you. 
(Applause)

You can grab the ring, you can ring that bell, when the ride is over, you can never tell. 
People tell you this one thing -- will make your life complete. 
So you, you give it everything you got and you wind up on the street. 
Then one day you wake up, and they tell you "you're a queen," but then you find that someone else is pulling on the strings. 
Rollercoaster, carousel. 
Where the highs are heaven, but the lows, oh, they can be hell. 
You can grab the ring, you can ring that bell, when the ride is over, you can never tell. 
The one you love, they love you -- oh yeah -- until the end of time. 
But lose your edge or lose your cool, they will drop you like a dime. 
Everyone is crowding 'round when fortune is your friend. 
When your luck is running out, you're all alone again. 
Rollercoaster, carousel.

You can grab the ring, you can ring that bell, when the ride is over you can never tell. 
Well, maybe I'm just cynical, and all these words are lies, but experience keeps telling me that the cautious one is wise. 
But caution makes you hesitate, and hesitate you're lost, so take your opportunities and never count the cost. 
Rollercoaster, carousel. 
Where the highs are heaven, but the lows, oh, they can be hell. 
You can grab the ring, you can ring that bell, when the ride is over -- over, over, you can never, ever tell.

Carousel, carousel, carousel, carousel.

(Applause) Thank you so much. 

Last year, I got a chance to watch the new "Star Wars" movie, which was fantastic, but one thing kept bugging me. 
I don't know if you noticed this or not. 
In this entirely technically advanced world, I did not see a single AED anywhere, which was totally shocking -- almost as shocking as not knowing what an AED is, which you guys do know. 
But for those at home, an AED is an automated external defibrillator. 
It's the device you use when your heart goes into cardiac arrest to shock it back into a normal rhythm, or, as one of the guys I was teaching a class to referred to it as: "The shocky-hearty-box thing." 
(Laughter) But I really can't blame the Empire, since health and safety regulations aren't really their first order of business. 
Though, even if we -- I think worse than not having an AED would be if there was one there, but just, no one knew where to find it. 
These devices can drastically increase your chance of survival -- almost like a tauntaun on Hoth. 
(Laughter) But I'm pretty sure that stormtrooper is going to be toast, regardless if we have an AED or not, since what happens is the chest plate is going to be quite hard to get off, and like that tauntaun, the AED has a very short window of time at which it's highly effective. 
In this case -- basically, we've got to use it within the first 10 minutes. 
The Jedi, on the other hand, have no problems with their outfits. 
Those robes open straight up, you can place the pads right onto the chest -- so upper-right-hand side of the chest, lower left, wait for the unit to determine if it's a shockable rhythm and get ready to shock. 
But, the Jedi do have a problem. 
They have a head appendage issue. 
And so I can be totally clear, thinking I'm ready to go, but I'm accidentally touching a tentacle and inadvertently shocking myself. 
(Laughter) So before you hit that button, make sure you are clear and everyone else is clear. 
Going back to that stormtrooper: If I did get that chest plate off in time, what would you do if you suddenly found there was a Wookiee under there, or possibly two Ewoks? 
(Laughter) Well, lucky for us, in the kit there's actually a razor, and we can use that to shave the chest on the upper right-hand side and the lower left. 
Wookiees also have another problem. 
They have an accessory issue. 
What we want to do is remove these -- anything between the two pads we want to remove, since it can cause something called "arcing." 
For those who don't know what arcing is, do you remember the Emperor, when he shoots electricity out the ends of his fingers -- (Laughter) that would be kind of like arcing. 
Another thing that -- Oh! By the way, he creates that by wearing wool socks under his robes. 
(Laughter) We can also get arcing if we have an extremely wet chest. 
The electricity travels across the surface instead of through the heart. 
We can correct this with the immortal words of Douglas Adams: "Don't panic," which most of us have done today -- and also always having a towel. 
So, good words to go by. 
The metal bikini -- unfortunately, this is where panic sets in -- like the modern bra, we have to make sure we remove, because this can cause severe arcing along with burns. 
But unfortunately this opens up an issue that's almost as controversial as talking about the prequels. 
(Laughter) The mere mention of the word "nipples," and people get into a little bit of a tizzy. 
By the way, that is not a nipple, that's a cupcake. 
(Laughter) Chances are, if you do have to use this, this is going to be on someone you know. 
And remember, everyone has nipples, except for Jabba. 
(Laughter) But he does love cupcakes. 
Speaking about Jabba, if we do have to use an AED on him, remember pad placement is the same, even though he doesn't have nipples. 
So it's going to be upper right-hand side, lower left. 
If we were going through, we're shocking, getting ready to go -- after we've done the shock, one of the things we need to do is remember to do compression. 
The preferred method is 30 compressions and two breaths in the center of the chest, between the nipples, pressing down at least two inches, no more than two and a half, at a rate of at least 100 beats a minute, no more than 120. 
Unfortunately, due to the size of Jabba's mouth and also what he puts in said mouth, we may not want to actually do the mouth-to-mouth part. 
So instead, we can do compression-only CPR. 
The way of remembering the compression-only part is we can actually use the Imperial March. 
I would sing it for you -- (Laughter) Unfortunately, that would be more something an interrogation droid would do. 
Yoda. 
Small little guy, like a baby. 
What we do is basically treat him like a baby, in the sense that we're going to place one pad in the center of the chest and one in the back. 
If we place them both in the front, they can be too close and cause severe arcing, so we want to avoid that. 
Hopefully, this helped to clarify and put some light on some of the darker issues of using an AED in the Star Wars universe, or any universe in total. 
I'll leave you with one point. 
Remember, if you do find yourself dealing with a Wookiee, do not shave the entire Wookiee. 
This takes way too much time, and it only pisses them off. 
(Laughter) Thank you very much. 
(Applause) 

How many companies have you interacted with today? 
Well, you got up in the morning, took a shower, washed your hair, used a hair dryer, ate breakfast -- ate cereals, fruit, yogurt, whatever -- had coffee -- tea. 
You took public transport to come here, or maybe used your private car. 
You interacted with the company that you work for or that you own. 
You interacted with your clients, your customers, and so on and so forth. 
I'm pretty sure there are at least seven companies you've interacted with today. 
Let me tell you a stunning statistic. 
One out of seven large, public corporations commit fraud every year. 
This is a US academic study that looks at US companies -- I have no reason to believe that it's different in Europe. 
This is a study that looks at both detected and undetected fraud using statistical methods. 
This is not petty fraud. 
These frauds cost the shareholders of these companies, and therefore society, on the order of 380 billion dollars per year. 
We can all think of some examples, right? 
The car industry's secrets aren't quite so secret anymore. 
Fraud has become a feature, not a bug, of the financial services industry. 
That's not me who's claiming that, that's the president of the American Finance Association who stated that in his presidential address. 
That's a huge problem if you think about, especially, an economy like Switzerland, which relies so much on the trust put into its financial industry. 
On the other hand, there are six out of seven companies who actually remain honest despite all temptations to start engaging in fraud. 
There are whistle-blowers like Michael Woodford, who blew the whistle on Olympus. 
These whistle-blowers risk their careers, their friendships, to bring out the truth about their companies. 
There are journalists like Anna Politkovskaya who risk even their lives to report human rights violations. 
She got killed -- every year, around 100 journalists get killed because of their conviction to bring out the truth. 
So in my talk today, I want to share with you some insights I've obtained and learned in the last 10 years of conducting research in this. 
I'm a researcher, a scientist working with economists, financial economists, ethicists, neuroscientists, lawyers and others trying to understand what makes humans tick, and how can we address this issue of fraud in corporations and therefore contribute to the improvement of the world. 
I want to start by sharing with you two very distinct visions of how people behave. 
First, meet Adam Smith, founding father of modern economics. 
His basic idea was that if everybody behaves in their own self-interests, that's good for everybody in the end. 
Self-interest isn't a narrowly defined concept just for your immediate utility. 
It has a long-run implication. 
Let's think about that. 
Think about this dog here. 
That might be us. 
There's this temptation -- I apologize to all vegetarians, but -- (Laughter) Dogs do like the bratwurst. 
(Laughter) Now, the straight-up, self-interested move here is to go for that. 
So my friend Adam here might jump up, get the sausage and thereby ruin all this beautiful tableware. 
But that's not what Adam Smith meant. 
He didn't mean disregard all consequences -- to the contrary. 
He would have thought, well, there may be negative consequences, for example, the owner might be angry with the dog and the dog, anticipating that, might not behave in this way. 
That might be us, weighing the benefits and costs of our actions. 
How does that play out? 
Well, many of you, I'm sure, have in your companies, especially if it's a large company, a code of conduct. 
And then if you behave according to that code of conduct, that improves your chances of getting a bonus payment. 
And on the other hand, if you disregard it, then there are higher chances of not getting your bonus or its being diminished. 
In other words, this is a very economic motivation of trying to get people to be more honest, or more aligned with the corporation's principles. 
Similarly, reputation is a very powerful economic force, right? 
We try to build a reputation, maybe for being honest, because then people trust us more in the future. 
Right? 
Adam Smith talked about the baker who's not producing good bread out of his benevolence for those people who consume the bread, but because he wants to sell more future bread. 
In my research, we find, for example, at the University of Zurich, that Swiss banks who get caught up in media, and in the context, for example, of tax evasion, of tax fraud, have bad media coverage. 
They lose net new money in the future and therefore make lower profits. 
That's a very powerful reputational force. 
Benefits and costs. 
Here's another viewpoint of the world. 
Meet Immanuel Kant, 18th-century German philosopher superstar. 
He developed this notion that independent of the consequences, some actions are just right and some are just wrong. 
It's just wrong to lie, for example. 
So, meet my friend Immanuel here. 
He knows that the sausage is very tasty, but he's going to turn away because he's a good dog. 
He knows it's wrong to jump up and risk ruining all this beautiful tableware. 
If you believe that people are motivated like that, then all the stuff about incentives, all the stuff about code of conduct and bonus systems and so on, doesn't make a whole lot of sense. 
People are motivated by different values perhaps. 
So, what are people actually motivated by? 
These two gentlemen here have perfect hairdos, but they give us very different views of the world. 
What do we do with this? 
Well, I'm an economist and we conduct so-called experiments to address this issue. 
We strip away facts which are confusing in reality. 
Reality is so rich, there is so much going on, it's almost impossible to know what drives people's behavior really. 
So let's do a little experiment together. 
Imagine the following situation. 
You're in a room alone, not like here. 
There's a five-franc coin like the one I'm holding up right now in front of you. 
Here are your instructions: toss the coin four times, and then on a computer terminal in front of you, enter the number of times tails came up. 
This is the situation. 
Here's the rub. 
For every time that you announce that you had a tails throw, you get paid five francs. 
So if you say I had two tails throws, you get paid 10 francs. 
If you say you had zero, you get paid zero francs. 
If you say, "I had four tails throws," then you get paid 20 francs. 
It's anonymous, nobody's watching what you're doing, and you get paid that money anonymously. 
I've got two questions for you. 
(Laughter) You know what's coming now, right? 
First, how would you behave in that situation? 
The second, look to your left and look to your right -- (Laughter) and think about how the person sitting next to you might behave in that situation. 
We did this experiment for real. 
We did it at the Manifesta art exhibition that took place here in Zurich recently, not with students in the lab at the university but with the real population, like you guys. 
First, a quick reminder of stats. 
If I throw the coin four times and it's a fair coin, then the probability that it comes up four times tails is 6.25 percent. 
And I hope you can intuitively see that the probability that all four of them are tails is much lower than if two of them are tails, right? 
Here are the specific numbers. 
Here's what happened. 
People did this experiment for real. 
Around 30 to 35 percent of people said, "Well, I had four tails throws." 
That's extremely unlikely. 
(Laughter) But the really amazing thing here, perhaps to an economist, is there are around 65 percent of people who did not say I had four tails throws, even though in that situation, nobody's watching you, the only consequence that's in place is you get more money if you say four than less. 
You leave 20 francs on the table by announcing zero. 
I don't know whether the other people all were honest or whether they also said a little bit higher or lower than what they did because it's anonymous. 
We only observed the distribution. 
But what I can tell you -- and here's another coin toss. 
There you go, it's tails. 
(Laughter) Don't check, OK? 
(Laughter) What I can tell you is that not everybody behaved like Adam Smith would have predicted. 
So what does that leave us with? 
Well, it seems people are motivated by certain intrinsic values and in our research, we look at this. 
We look at the idea that people have so-called protected values. 
A protected value isn't just any value. 
A protected value is a value where you're willing to pay a price to uphold that value. 
You're willing to pay a price to withstand the temptation to give in. 
And the consequence is you feel better if you earn money in a way that's consistent with your values. 
Let me show you this again in the metaphor of our beloved dog here. 
If we succeed in getting the sausage without violating our values, then the sausage tastes better. 
That's what our research shows. 
If, on the other hand, we do so -- if we get the sausage and in doing so we actually violate values, we value the sausage less. 
Quantitatively, that's quite powerful. 
We can measure these protected values, for example, by a survey measure. 
Simple, nine-item survey that's quite predictive in these experiments. 
If you think about the average of the population and then there's a distribution around it -- people are different, we all are different. 
People who have a set of protected values that's one standard deviation above the average, they discount money they receive by lying by about 25 percent. 
That means a dollar received when lying is worth to them only 75 cents without any incentives you put in place for them to behave honestly. 
It's their intrinsic motivation. 
By the way, I'm not a moral authority. 
I'm not saying I have all these beautiful values, right? 
But I'm interested in how people behave and how we can leverage that richness in human nature to actually improve the workings of our organizations. 
So there are two very, very different visions here. 
On the one hand, you can appeal to benefits and costs and try to get people to behave according to them. 
On the other hand, you can select people who have the values and the desirable characteristics, of course -- competencies that go in line with your organization. 
I do not yet know where these protected values really come from. 
Is it nurture or is it nature? 
What I can tell you is that the distribution looks pretty similar for men and women. 
It looks pretty similar for those who had studied economics or those who had studied psychology. 
It looks even pretty similar around different age categories among adults. 
But I don't know yet how this develops over a lifetime. 
That will be the subject of future research. 
The idea I want to leave you with is it's all right to appeal to incentives. 
I'm an economist; I certainly believe in the fact that incentives work. 
But do think about selecting the right people rather than having people and then putting incentives in place. 
Selecting the right people with the right values may go a long way to saving a lot of trouble and a lot of money in your organizations. 
In other words, it will pay off to put people first. 
Thank you. 
(Applause) 

It's 1878. 
Sir Francis Galton gives a remarkable talk. 
He's speaking to the anthropologic institute of Great Britain and Ireland. 
Known for his pioneering work in human intelligence, Galton is a brilliant polymath. 
He's an explorer, an anthropologist, a sociologist, a psychologist and a statistician. 
He's also a eugenist. 
In this talk, he presents a new technique by which he can combine photographs and produce composite portraits. 
This technique could be used to characterize different types of people. 
Galton thinks that if he combines photographs of violent criminals, he will discover the face of criminality. 
But to his surprise, the composite portrait that he produces is beautiful. 
Galton's surprising finding raises deep questions: What is beauty? 
Why do certain configurations of line and color and form excite us so? 
For most of human history, these questions have been approached using logic and speculation. 
But in the last few decades, scientists have addressed the question of beauty using ideas from evolutionary psychology and tools of neuroscience. 
We're beginning to glimpse the why and the how of beauty, at least in terms of what it means for the human face and form. 
And in the process, we're stumbling upon some surprises. 
When it comes to seeing beauty in each other, while this decision is certainly subjective for the individual, it's sculpted by factors that contribute to the survival of the group. 
Many experiments have shown that a few basic parameters contribute to what makes a face attractive. 
These include averaging, symmetry and the effects of hormones. 
Let's take each one of these in turn. 
Galton's finding that composite or average faces are typically more attractive than each individual face that contributes to the average has been replicated many times. 
This laboratory finding fits with many people's intuitions. 
Average faces represent the central tendencies of a group. 
People with mixed features represent different populations, and presumably harbor greater genetic diversity and adaptability to the environment. 
Many people find mixed-race individuals attractive and inbred families less so. 
The second factor that contributes to beauty is symmetry. 
People generally find symmetric faces more attractive than asymmetric ones. 
Developmental abnormalities are often associated with asymmetries. 
And in plants, animals and humans, asymmetries often arise from parasitic infections. 
Symmetry, it turns out, is also an indicator of health. 
In the 1930s, a man named Maksymilian Faktorowicz recognized the importance of symmetry for beauty when he designed the beauty micrometer. 
With this device, he could measure minor asymmetric flaws which he could then make up for with products he sold from his company, named brilliantly after himself, Max Factor, which, as you know, is one of the world's most famous brands for "make up." 
The third factor that contributes to facial attractiveness is the effect of hormones. 
And here, I need to apologize for confining my comments to heterosexual norms. 
But estrogen and testosterone play important roles in shaping features that we find attractive. 
Estrogen produces features that signal fertility. 
Men typically find women attractive who have elements of both youth and maturity. 
A face that's too baby-like might mean that the girl is not yet fertile, so men find women attractive who have large eyes, full lips and narrow chins as indicators of youth, and high cheekbones as an indicator of maturity. 
Testosterone produces features that we regard as typically masculine. 
These include heavier brows, thinner cheeks and bigger, squared-off jaws. 
But here's a fascinating irony. 
In many species, if anything, testosterone suppresses the immune system. 
So the idea that testosterone-infused features are a fitness indicator doesn't really make a whole lot of sense. 
Here, the logic is turned on its head. 
Instead of a fitness indicator, scientists invoke a handicap principle. 
The most commonly cited example of a handicap is the peacock's tail. 
This beautiful but cumbersome tail doesn't exactly help the peacock avoid predators and approach peahens. 
Why should such an extravagant appendage evolve? 
Even Charles Darwin, in an 1860 letter to Asa Gray wrote that the sight of the peacock's tail made him physically ill. 
He couldn't explain it with his theory of natural selection, and out of this frustration, he developed the theory of sexual selection. 
On this account, the display of the peacock's tail is about sexual enticement, and this enticement means it's more likely the peacock will mate and have offspring. 
Now, the modern twist on this display argument is that the peacock is also advertising its health to the peahen. 
Only especially fit organisms can afford to divert resources to maintaining such an extravagant appendage. 
Only especially fit men can afford the price that testosterone levies on their immune system. 
And by analogy, think of the fact that only very rich men can afford to pay more than $10,000 for a watch as a display of their financial fitness. 
Now, many people hear these kinds of evolutionary claims and think they mean that we somehow are unconsciously seeking mates who are healthy. 
And I think this idea is probably not right. 
Teenagers and young adults are not exactly known for making decisions that are predicated on health concerns. 
But they don't have to be, and let me explain why. 
Imagine a population in which people have three different kinds of preferences: for green, for orange and for red. 
From their point of view, these preferences have nothing to do with health; they just like what they like. 
But if it were also the case that these preferences are associated with the different likelihood of producing offspring -- let's say in a ratio of 3:2:1 -- then in the first generation, there would be 3 greens to 2 oranges to 1 red, and in each subsequent generation, the proportion of greens increase, so that in 10 generations, 98 percent of this population has a green preference. 
Now, a scientist coming in and sampling this population discovers that green preferences are universal. 
So the point about this little abstract example is that while preferences for specific physical features can be arbitrary for the individual, if those features are heritable and they are associated with a reproductive advantage, over time, they become universal for the group. 
So what happens in the brain when we see beautiful people? 
Attractive faces activate parts of our visual cortex in the back of the brain, an area called the fusiform gyrus, that is especially tuned to processing faces, and an adjacent area called the lateral occipital complex, that is especially attuned to processing objects. 
In addition, attractive faces activate parts of our reward and pleasure centers in the front and deep in the brain, and these include areas that have complicated names, like the ventral striatum, the orbitofrontal cortex and the ventromedial prefrontal cortex. 
Our visual brain that is tuned to processing faces interacts with our pleasure centers to underpin the experience of beauty. 
Amazingly, while we all engage with beauty, without our knowledge, beauty also engages us. 
Our brains respond to attractive faces even when we're not thinking about beauty. 
We conducted an experiment in which people saw a series of faces, and in one condition, they had to decide if a pair of faces were the same or a different person. 
Even in this condition, attractive faces drove neural activity robustly in their visual cortex, despite the fact that they were thinking about a person's identity and not their beauty. 
Another group similarly found automatic responses to beauty within our pleasure centers. 
Taken together, these studies suggest that our brain automatically responds to beauty by linking vision and pleasure. 
These beauty detectors, it seems, ping every time we see beauty, regardless of whatever else we might be thinking. 
We also have a "beauty is good" stereotype embedded in the brain. 
Within the orbitofrontal cortex, there's overlapping neural activity in response to beauty and to goodness, and this happens even when people aren't explicitly thinking about beauty or goodness. 
Our brains seem to reflexively associate beauty and good. 
And this reflexive association may be the biologic trigger for the many social effects of beauty. 
Attractive people receive all kinds of advantages in life. 
They're regarded as more intelligent, more trustworthy, they're given higher pay and lesser punishments, even when such judgments are not warranted. 
These kinds of observations reveal beauty's ugly side. 
In my lab, we recently found that people with minor facial anomalies and disfigurements are regarded as less good, less kind, less intelligent, less competent and less hardworking. 
Unfortunately, we also have a "disfigured is bad" stereotype. 
This stereotype is probably exploited and magnified by images in popular media, in which facial disfigurement is often used as a shorthand to depict someone of villainous character. 
We need to understand these kinds of implicit biases if we are to overcome them and aim for a society in which we treat people fairly, based on their behavior and not on the happenstance of their looks. 
Let me leave you with one final thought. 
Beauty is a work in progress. 
The so-called universal attributes of beauty were selected for during the almost two million years of the Pleistocene. 
Life was nasty, brutish and a very long time ago. 
The selection criteria for reproductive success from that time doesn't really apply today. 
For example, death by parasite is not one of the top ways that people die, at least not in the technologically developed world. 
From antibiotics to surgery, birth control to in vitro fertilization, the filters for reproductive success are being relaxed. 
And under these relaxed conditions, preference and trait combinations are free to drift and become more variable. 
Even as we are profoundly affecting our environment, modern medicine and technological innovation is profoundly affecting the very essence of what it means to look beautiful. 
The universal nature of beauty is changing even as we're changing the universe. 
Thank you. 
(Applause) 

Here's an intriguing fact. 
In the developed world, everywhere, women live an average of six to eight years longer than men do. 
Six to eight years longer. 
That's, like, a huge gap. 
In 2015, the "Lancet" published an article showing that men in rich countries are twice as likely to die as women are at any age. 
But there is one place in the world where men live as long as women. 
It's a remote, mountainous zone, a blue zone, where super longevity is common to both sexes. 
This is the blue zone in Sardinia, an Italian island in the Mediterranean, between Corsica and Tunisia, where there are six times as many centenarians as on the Italian mainland, less than 200 miles away. 
There are 10 times as many centenarians as there are in North America. 
It's the only place where men live as long as women. 
But why? 
My curiosity was piqued. 
I decided to research the science and the habits of the place, and I started with the genetic profile. 
I discovered soon enough that genes account for just 25 percent of their longevity. 
The other 75 percent is lifestyle. 
So what does it take to live to 100 or beyond? 
What are they doing right? 
What you're looking at is an aerial view of Villagrande. 
It's a village at the epicenter of the blue zone where I went to investigate this, and as you can see, architectural beauty is not its main virtue, density is: tightly spaced houses, interwoven alleys and streets. 
It means that the villagers' lives constantly intersect. 
And as I walked through the village, I could feel hundreds of pairs of eyes watching me from behind doorways and curtains, from behind shutters. 
Because like all ancient villages, Villagrande couldn't have survived without this structure, without its walls, without its cathedral, without its village square, because defense and social cohesion defined its design. 
Urban priorities changed as we moved towards the industrial revolution because infectious disease became the risk of the day. 
But what about now? 
Now, social isolation is the public health risk of our time. 
Now, a third of the population says they have two or fewer people to lean on. 
But let's go to Villagrande now as a contrast to meet some centenarians. 
Meet Giuseppe Murinu. He's 102, a supercentenarian and a lifelong resident of the village of Villagrande. 
He was a gregarious man. 
He loved to recount stories such as how he lived like a bird from what he could find on the forest floor during not one but two world wars, how he and his wife, who also lived past 100, raised six children in a small, homey kitchen where I interviewed him. 
Here he is with his sons Angelo and Domenico, both in their 70s and looking after their father, and who were quite frankly very suspicious of me and my daughter who came along with me on this research trip, because the flip side of social cohesion is a wariness of strangers and outsiders. 
But Giuseppe, he wasn't suspicious at all. 
He was a happy-go-lucky guy, very outgoing with a positive outlook. 
And I wondered: so is that what it takes to live to be 100 or beyond, thinking positively? 
Actually, no. 
(Laughter) Meet Giovanni Corrias. He's 101, the grumpiest person I have ever met. 
(Laughter) And he put a lie to the notion that you have to be positive to live a long life. 
And there is evidence for this. 
When I asked him why he lived so long, he kind of looked at me under hooded eyelids and he growled, "Nobody has to know my secrets." 
(Laughter) But despite being a sourpuss, the niece who lived with him and looked after him called him "Il Tesoro," "my treasure." 
And she respected him and loved him, and she told me, when I questioned this obvious loss of her freedom, "You just don't understand, do you? 
Looking after this man is a pleasure. 
It's a huge privilege for me. 
This is my heritage." 
And indeed, wherever I went to interview these centenarians, I found a kitchen party. 
Here's Giovanni with his two nieces, Maria above him and beside him his great-niece Sara, who came when I was there to bring fresh fruits and vegetables. 
And I quickly discovered by being there that in the blue zone, as people age, and indeed across their lifespans, they're always surrounded by extended family, by friends, by neighbors, the priest, the barkeeper, the grocer. 
People are always there or dropping by. 
They are never left to live solitary lives. 
This is unlike the rest of the developed world, where as George Burns quipped, "Happiness is having a large, loving, caring family in another city." 
(Laughter) Now, so far we've only met men, long-living men, but I met women too, and here you see Zia Teresa. 
She, at over 100, taught me how to make the local specialty, which is called culurgiones, which are these large pasta pockets like ravioli about this size, this size, and they're filled with high-fat ricotta and mint and drenched in tomato sauce. 
And she showed me how to make just the right crimp so they wouldn't open, and she makes them with her daughters every Sunday and distributes them by the dozens to neighbors and friends. 
And that's when I discovered a low-fat, gluten-free diet is not what it takes to live to 100 in the blue zone. 
(Applause) Now, these centenarians' stories along with the science that underpins them prompted me to ask myself some questions too, such as, when am I going to die and how can I put that day off? 
And as you will see, the answer is not what we expect. 
Julianne Holt-Lunstad is a researcher at Brigham Young University and she addressed this very question in a series of studies of tens of thousands of middle aged people much like this audience here. 
And she looked at every aspect of their lifestyle: their diet, their exercise, their marital status, how often they went to the doctor, whether they smoked or drank, etc. 
She recorded all of this and then she and her colleagues sat tight and waited for seven years to see who would still be breathing. 
And of the people left standing, what reduced their chances of dying the most? 
That was her question. 
So let's now look at her data in summary, going from the least powerful predictor to the strongest. 
OK? 
So clean air, which is great, it doesn't predict how long you will live. 
Whether you have your hypertension treated is good. 
Still not a strong predictor. 
Whether you're lean or overweight, you can stop feeling guilty about this, because it's only in third place. 
How much exercise you get is next, still only a moderate predictor. 
Whether you've had a cardiac event and you're in rehab and exercising, getting higher now. 
Whether you've had a flu vaccine. 
Did anybody here know that having a flu vaccine protects you more than doing exercise? 
Whether you were drinking and quit, or whether you're a moderate drinker, whether you don't smoke, or if you did, whether you quit, and getting towards the top predictors are two features of your social life. 
First, your close relationships. 
These are the people that you can call on for a loan if you need money suddenly, who will call the doctor if you're not feeling well or who will take you to the hospital, or who will sit with you if you're having an existential crisis, if you're in despair. 
Those people, that little clutch of people are a strong predictor, if you have them, of how long you'll live. 
And then something that surprised me, something that's called social integration. 
This means how much you interact with people as you move through your day. 
How many people do you talk to? 
And these mean both your weak and your strong bonds, so not just the people you're really close to, who mean a lot to you, but, like, do you talk to the guy who every day makes you your coffee? 
Do you talk to the postman? 
Do you talk to the woman who walks by your house every day with her dog? 
Do you play bridge or poker, have a book club? 
Those interactions are one of the strongest predictors of how long you'll live. 
Now, this leads me to the next question: if we now spend more time online than on any other activity, including sleeping, we're now up to 11 hours a day, one hour more than last year, by the way, does it make a difference? 
Why distinguish between interacting in person and interacting via social media? 
Is it the same thing as being there if you're in contact constantly with your kids through text, for example? 
Well, the short answer to the question is no, it's not the same thing. 
Face-to-face contact releases a whole cascade of neurotransmitters, and like a vaccine, they protect you now in the present and well into the future. 
So simply making eye contact with somebody, shaking hands, giving somebody a high-five is enough to release oxytocin, which increases your level of trust and it lowers your cortisol levels. 
So it lowers your stress. 
And dopamine is generated, which gives us a little high and it kills pain. 
It's like a naturally produced morphine. 
Now, all of this passes under our conscious radar, which is why we conflate online activity with the real thing. 
But we do have evidence now, fresh evidence, that there is a difference. 
So let's look at some of the neuroscience. 
Elizabeth Redcay, a neuroscientist at the University of Maryland, tried to map the difference between what goes on in our brains when we interact in person versus when we're watching something that's static. 
And what she did was she compared the brain function of two groups of people, those interacting live with her or with one of her research associates in a dynamic conversation, and she compared that to the brain activity of people who were watching her talk about the same subject but in a canned video, like on YouTube. 
And by the way, if you want to know how she fit two people in an MRI scanner at the same time, talk to me later. 
So what's the difference? 
This is your brain on real social interaction. 
What you're seeing is the difference in brain activity between interacting in person and taking in static content. 
In orange, you see the brain areas that are associated with attention, social intelligence -- that means anticipating what somebody else is thinking and feeling and planning -- and emotional reward. 
And these areas become much more engaged when we're interacting with a live partner. 
Now, these richer brain signatures might be why recruiters from Fortune 500 companies evaluating candidates thought that the candidates were smarter when they heard their voices compared to when they just read their pitches in a text, for example, or an email or a letter. 
Now, our voices and body language convey a rich signal. 
It shows that we're thinking, feeling, sentient human beings who are much more than an algorithm. 
Now, this research by Nicholas Epley at the University of Chicago Business School is quite amazing because it tells us a simple thing. 
If somebody hears your voice, they think you're smarter. 
I mean, that's quite a simple thing. 
Now, to return to the beginning, why do women live longer than men? 
And one major reason is that women are more likely to prioritize and groom their face-to-face relationships over their lifespans. 
Fresh evidence shows that these in-person friendships create a biological force field against disease and decline. 
And it's not just true of humans but their primate relations, our primate relations as well. 
Anthropologist Joan Silk's work shows that female baboons who have a core of female friends show lower levels of stress via their cortisol levels, they live longer and they have more surviving offspring. 
At least three stable relationships. 
That was the magic number. 
Think about it. 
I hope you guys have three. 
The power of such face-to-face contact is really why there are the lowest rates of dementia among people who are socially engaged. 
It's why women who have breast cancer are four times more likely to survive their disease than loners are. 
Why men who've had a stroke who meet regularly to play poker or to have coffee or to play old-timer's hockey -- I'm Canadian, after all -- (Laughter) are better protected by that social contact than they are by medication. 
Why men who've had a stroke who meet regularly -- this is something very powerful they can do. 
This face-to-face contact provides stunning benefits, yet now almost a quarter of the population says they have no one to talk to. 
We can do something about this. 
Like Sardinian villagers, it's a biological imperative to know we belong, and not just the women among us. 
Building in-person interaction into our cities, into our workplaces, into our agendas bolsters the immune system, sends feel-good hormones surging through the bloodstream and brain and helps us live longer. 
I call this building your village, and building it and sustaining it is a matter of life and death. 
Thank you. 
(Applause) Helen Walters: Susan, come back. I have a question for you. 
I'm wondering if there's a middle path. 
So you talk about the neurotransmitters connecting when in face-to-face, but what about digital technology? 
We've seen enormous improvements in digital technology like FaceTime, things like that. 
Does that work too? 
I mean, I see my nephew. 
He plays Minecraft and he's yelling at his friends. 
It seems like he's connecting pretty well. 
Is that useful? Is that helpful? 
Susan Pinker: Some of the data are just emerging. 
The data are so fresh that the digital revolution happened and the health data trailed behind. 
So we're just learning, but I would say there are some improvements that we could make in the technology. 
For example, the camera on your laptop is at the top of the screen, so for example, when you're looking into the screen, you're not actually making eye contact. 
So something as simple as even just looking into the camera can increase those neurotransmitters, or maybe changing the position of the camera. 
So it's not identical, but I think we are getting closer with the technology. 
HW: Great. Thank you so much. 
SP: Thank you. 
(Applause) 

I want to talk to you tonight about the work that makes all other work possible, about the millions of women who go to work in our homes every single day, caring for children as nannies, caring for our loved ones with disabilities and our elders, as home care workers, maintaining sanity in our homes as cleaners. 
It's the work that makes all other work possible. 
And it's mostly done by women, more than 90 percent women, disproportionately women of color. 
And the work itself is associated with work that women have historically done, work that's been made incredibly invisible and taken for granted in our culture. 
But it's so fundamental to everything else in our world. 
It makes it possible for all of us to go out and do what we do in the world every single day, knowing that the most precious aspects of our lives are in good hands. 
But we don't think about it that way. 
It's almost defined by its invisibility. 
You could go into any neighborhood and not know which homes are also workplaces. 
There's no sign. 
There's no list or registry. 
It's just invisible. 
And it's this work that is not even referred to as real work. 
It's referred to as "help." 
It's often seen as unskilled, not seen as professional. 
And race has played a profound role in how we value this work in our culture. 
Some of the first domestic workers in the United States were black women who were enslaved, and racial exclusion has shaped their conditions for generations. 
In the 1930s, when Congress was discussing the labor laws that would be a part of the New Deal, that would protect all workers, Southern members of Congress refused to support those labor laws if they included protections for domestic workers and farmworkers. 
That history of racial exclusion and our cultural devaluing of work that's associated with women now means that millions of women go to work every single day, work incredibly hard and still can't make ends meet. 
They earn poverty wages without a safety net, so that the women that we're counting on to take care of us and our families can't take care of their own, doing this work. 
But my work over the last 20 years has been about changing precisely that. 
It's about making these jobs good jobs that you can take pride in and support your family on. 
At the National Domestic Workers Alliance, we've been working hard in states to pass new laws that will protect domestic workers from discrimination and sexual harassment, that will create days of rest, paid time off, even. 
So far, eight states have passed domestic workers bills of rights. 
Yes. 
(Applause) And during the Obama administration, we were successful in bringing two million home care workers under minimum wage and overtime protections for the first time since 1937. 
(Applause) Most recently, we've been really excited to launch a new portable benefits platform for domestic workers, called "Alia," which allows for domestic workers with multiple clients to give them access to benefits for the very first time. 
So really important progress is being made. 
But I would argue tonight that one of the most important things that domestic workers can provide is actually what they can teach us about humanity itself and about what it will take to create a more humane world for our children. 
In the face of extreme immorality, domestic workers can be our moral compass. 
And it makes sense, because what they do is so fundamental to the very basics of human need and humanity. 
They are there when we are born into this world; they shape who we become in this world; and they are with us as we prepare to leave this world. 
And their experiences with families are so varied. 
They have some relationships with the families that they work for that are incredibly positive and mutually supportive and last for years and years. 
And then the opposite also happens. 
And we've seen cases of sexual violence and assault, of extreme forms of abuse and exploitation. 
We've seen cases of human trafficking. 
Domestic workers live in poor neighborhoods, and then they go to work in very wealthy ones. 
They cross cultures and generations and borders and boundaries, and their job, no matter what, is to show up and care -- to nurture, to feed, to clothe, to bathe, to listen, to encourage, to ensure safety, to support dignity ... 
to care no matter what. 
I want to tell you a story of a woman I met early on in this work. 
Her name is Lily. 
Lily and her family lived in Jamaica, and when she was 15 years old, she was approached by an American couple who were looking for a live-in nanny to come live with them in the United States and help them care for their children. 
They offered Lily's family that if she came to work as their nanny, she would be able to have access to a US education, and she would have a weekly salary sent home to help her family financially. 
They decided it was a good idea and decided to take the opportunity. 
Lily held up her end of the bargain and helped to raise three children. 
But all communication with her family was severed: no letters, no phone calls. 
She was never allowed to go to school, and she was never paid -- for 15 years. 
One day, she saw an article in a newspaper about another domestic worker with a really similar story to hers, another case that I was working on at the time, and she found a way to reach me. 
She also found a way to reach her brother, who was living in the United States at the time as well. 
Between the two of us, we were able to help her escape. 
And she had the help of one of the children. 
One of the children was old enough to realize that the way his nanny was being treated was wrong, and he gave her the money that he had been saving through his childhood to help her escape. 
But here's the thing about this story. 
She was essentially enslaved for 15 years. 
Human trafficking and slavery is a criminal offense. 
And so her lawyers and I asked Lily, did she want to press criminal charges for what had happened to her. 
And after thinking about what it would mean, she said no, because she didn't want the children to be separated from their parents. 
Instead, we filed a civil lawsuit, and we eventually won the case, and her case became a rallying cry for domestic workers everywhere. 
She was reunited with her family and went on to have a family of her own. 
But the thing that's so profound to me about this story is, despite having 15 years stolen from her life, it did not affect the care and compassion that she felt for the children. 
And I see this from domestic workers all the time. 
In the face of indignities and our failure to respect and value this work in our culture, they still show up, and they care. 
They're simply too proximate to our shared humanity. 
They know how your toddler likes to be held as they take their bottle before a nap. 
They know how your mother likes her tea, how to make her smile and tell stories despite her dementia. 
They are so proximate to our humanity. 
They know that at the end of the day, these are people who are part of families -- someone's mother, someone's grandmother, someone's best friend and someone's baby; undeniably human, and therefore, not disposable. 
Domestic workers know that any time a single person becomes disposable, it's a slippery slope. 
You see, the cultural devaluing of domestic work is a reflection of a hierarchy of human value that defines everything in our world, a hierarchy that values the lives and contributions of some groups of people over others, based on race, gender, class, immigration status -- any number of categories. 
And that hierarchy of human value requires stories about those groups of people in order to sustain itself. 
So these stories have seeped deep into our culture about how some people are less intelligent, some people are less intuitive, weaker, by extension, less trustworthy, less valuable and ultimately, less human. 
And domestic workers know it's a slippery slope when we start to see a worker as less than a real worker, to a woman as less than a woman, to a mother as less than a mother, to a child as less than a child. 
In the spring of 2018, the Trump administration announced a new policy at the US-Mexico border, a zero-tolerance policy, to forcibly separate all children from their parents, who were arriving at the border seeking asylum; children as young as 18 months, separated from their parents after a long and arduous journey to reach the US-Mexico border in search of safety and a new beginning. 
Thousands of children separated. 
And because they were migrants, they were treated as less than children. 
In response, I helped to organize the Families Belong Together Vigil at the Ursula Border Patrol Processing Center in McAllen, Texas, on Father's Day. 
Inside that processing center, there were hundreds of children who were being held, processed and then prepared to be shipped all over country to be jailed in facilities hundreds of miles away from their parents. 
I saw with my own eyes children not [old] enough for kindergarten in unmarked buses, being shipped off to jails hundreds of miles away. 
And as they passed us by, they reached for us through the windows, as we stood vigil to let them know that they are not alone, and we are fighting for them. 
Domestic workers came from all over Texas to be a part of the vigil. 
They saw in those families their own family stories. 
They had also come here in search of safety and a new beginning, a better life for their families, and they saw in the eyes of those children their own children. 
And through our tears, we looked at each other and we asked each other, "How did we get here, to putting children in cages and separating them from the people who love them the most in the world?" 
How? 
And what I thought to myself was: if domestic workers were in charge, this never would have happened. 
Our humanity would never have been so disposable that we would be treating children in this way. 
The Dalai Lama once said that love and compassion are necessities, not luxuries. 
Without them, humanity cannot survive. 
In other words, they are fundamental to human existence. 
Domestic workers are in charge of the fundamentals. 
They love and they care, and they show compassion no matter what. 
We live in a time of moral choices everywhere we turn: at the border, at the ballot box, in our workplaces, right in our homes, full of moral choices. 
As you go about your day and you encounter these moral choices, think of Lily. 
Think like Lily. 
Think like a domestic worker who shows up and cares no matter what. 
Love and compassion, no matter what. 
Show up like a domestic worker, because our children are counting on us. 
Thank you. 
(Applause) 

Every year, more than four to five million people die due to exposure to outdoor air pollution around the world. 
This petri dish that you are looking at contains approximately 20 minutes' worth of pollution captured off a pyrolysis plant. 
This is PM 2.5. 
These particles -- you can see it right now, but when they're out there in the air, you won't see them. 
These are so tiny that our lungs -- our bodies cannot filter them, and they end up in our bodies -- give us asthma and lung cancer if not treated in the right time. 
On a trip back to India, when I was a student in 2012, I took this picture. 
This picture stuck in my head. 
On one side, you see this exhaust of a diesel generator, the same generator which is a sign of human progress, which is a sign of rapid industrialization and what we have become as a society in the last 100 years, generating energy. 
But on the other side, you see this very interesting triangular, black-colored swatch, that is produced by the same residual particulate waste created by the emissions of the generator. 
Now, this picture gave me an idea and got me thinking about rethinking both pollution and inks, because it was making that black-colored mark. 
Now, the reality is that most of the black ink that we use conventionally is traditionally produced by conventionally burning fossil fuels in factories. 
There are factories around the world that are burning fossil fuels to produce carbon black, to make black inks that we use on an everyday basis. 
But given that millions of liters of fossil fuels are already being burned out there by our cars, our engines and our exhaust out there, what if you could capture that pollution and use it to recycle and make those inks? 
I decided to give this experiment a shot. 
I went back to my lab back in Boston and conducted a small experiment. 
In Boston, I couldn't find much pollution to play with, so I resorted to using a candle. 
This was an experiment. 
I burnt a candle, built this contraption that would suck in that candle soot, mixed it with some vegetable oil and vodka, because to a DIY hacker, these were really easily available. 
(Laughter) And after mixing them, you could churn out a very rudimentary form of ink that would go into a cartridge, and now you could print with it. 
This was my "Hello, World!" of experimenting with printing with pollution. 
This is the same pollution that I showed you in the petri dish, which is the result of any fossil fuel that is being burned out there. 
In 2015, I decided to take this experimentation forward and set up a lab in India to work on the capture and recycling of air pollution. 
In the good times, the lab used to look something like this. 
But experimentations were not always controlled, and disasters happened. 
And while experimentation would happen, the lab would end up looking something like this. 
Well, we knew where we wanted to go, but we were not sure how exactly to reach there. 
The passersby who used to go by that lab through that building used to, at times, think, "These guys are making bombs in there," because there was too much fire, wires and smoke in the same vicinity. 
(Laughter) We decided, let's move to a garage and take experiments forward. 
We took a garage, and during the early stages, we were driving around Bangalore with contraptions like these. 
This is an early-stage prototype. 
Imagine the looks people gave us, "What are these cars driving around doing?" 
This is an early-stage prototype of our system that would capture pollution that is being released from a conventional diesel-based car. 
This is an early stage of the technology. 
We advanced the technology and created this into this version that would capture pollution from static sources of pollution, like a diesel generator. 
If you see, all the fumes disappear as soon as you turn this machine on. 
Without affecting the performance of the engine, we are able to capture 95 percent worth of pollution released from the diesel generator. 
This is the particulate matter that we are talking about that we capture, in this case, within three to four hours of operation of a generator. 
And while our experiments and our research was advancing, a very big company, a very big brand, approached us and said, "We want to take this idea further with you guys, and take this further in a very big celebrated form." 
They said, "Let's do a global art campaign with the inks that you are making off this pollution." 
I'll show you what the ink looks like. 
So, this pen is made by recycling 40 to 50 minutes of that car pollution that we are talking about, the same pollution that is in the petri dish. 
And it's a very sharp black that you can write with. 
So I'm going to write ... 
PM 2.5, that's incorrect. 
So this is a very sharp black that is generated by the same pollution. 
After much work on the lab-level research, we got an offer from a big corporation to do a very big trial of this idea. 
And it happened to be a brand, and we didn't think twice. 
We said, "Let's go ahead." 
Inventing in the lab is one thing and taking ideas and deploying them in the real world is completely another. 
During early stages, we had to resort to using our own houses and own kitchens as our ink-making factories, and our own bedrooms and living rooms as the first assembly line for making these inks. 
This is my cofounder Nikhil's own bedroom, that is being used to supply inks to artists all around the world, who would paint with AIR-INK. 
And that's him, delivering AIR-INKs to the ports so that the artists around the world can use it. 
Soon, we started seeing that thousands of artists around the world started using AIR-INK, and artworks started emerging like this. 
Soon, thousands of black-and-white, pollution-made artworks started emerging on a global scale. 
And believe me, for a group of scientists and engineers and inventors, there was nothing more satisfying than that the product of their work is now being used by some of the finest artists around the world. 
This is the cover of "Contagious" magazine last year, that was done by using the same ink that we made back in our labs. 
This is a famous painting by the British artist, Christian Furr, who painted it for the song "Paint It Black" by The Rolling Stones. 
Now, there's more to this pen and this ink than just the popular and pop-culture artworks. 
And now our goal is to create a company that can actually make some black money -- I mean, just money -- (Laughter) and high-quality printing processes and inks that can replace the conventional black inks that have been produced for the last thousands of years around the world. 
Soon after our growing popularity and artworks around the world, we started facing a very different kind of a problem. 
We started getting spammed by polluters, who would send us bags full of pollution to our office address, asking us, "What can we do with this pollution?" 
Our lab back in Bombay right now has pollution samples that have come from London, from India, from China, you name it. 
And this is just the beginning. 
This polluter sent us this specific image, asking us that these are all bags filled with PM 2.5, and can we recycle it for him if we paid him some money. 
Well, what would he have done if we did not take that pollution? 
He would probably find a nearby river or a landfill and dump it over there. 
But now, because we had the economics of AIR-INK figured out on the other side, we could incentivize him to give us this pollution and make inks from it, and turn it into even more valuable products. 
Now, pollution, as we all know, is a global killer. 
We can't claim that our ink will solve the world's pollution problem. 
But it does show what can be done if you look at this problem slightly differently. 
Look at this T-shirt I'm holding right now. 
This is made from the same AIR-INK I'm talking about. 
It's made from the same pollution that is inside this petri dish. 
And the same pollution we are all breathing in when we are walking outdoors. 
And we are on our way to do better than this. 
Thank you very much. 
(Applause) 

Look all around you. 
Whether you're in a subway, a park, an airport, a restaurant, even at this conference, all of you have a phone in your hands or maybe in your pockets. 
How many of you have a book? 
Very few, right? 
This is the sight that used to greet me every time I walked out of my office block. 
I was surrounded by a sea of 20-something professionals glued to their phones. 
And not a single one had a book in their hands. 
And this used to make me very, very frustrated. 
I was a bookworm all my life. 
Books formed the milestones of my life. 
The first man I fell in love with was Mr. Darcy. 
I first read "Harry Potter" when I was 21, on a summer break from college. 
And I remember the first night I spent in a little flat I bought in my mid-20s, very proudly, and I spent the whole night reading "The Da Vinci Code." 
And then I'm going to make a terrible confession: even today, when I'm low, I get into bed with "War and Peace." 
Don't laugh. 
(Laughter) But I was also like all those people I saw around me: I, too, lived on my phone. 
I ordered my groceries online, and soon my app knew that I needed a monthly dose of diapers. 
I booked my cinemas on my phone. 
I booked planes on my phone. 
And when I did the long commute back home like most urban Indians, and was stuck in traffic, I passed the time on WhatsApp, video-chatting my twin. 
I was part of an extraordinary revolution that was happening in India. 
Indians are the second-largest users of smartphones in the world. 
And data prices have been slashed so radically that half of urban India and even a part of rural India now have a smartphone with a data connection in their hands. 
And if you know anything about India, you'll know that "half" means, like, all of America or something. 
You know, it's large numbers. 
(Laughter) And these numbers are just growing and growing and growing. 
They're exploding. 
And what they're doing is empowering Indians in all kinds of extraordinary ways. 
And yet, none of these changes that I was seeing around me were reflected in my world, my world of books. 
I live in a country the size of Europe, and it only has 50 decent bookshops. 
And Indians just didn't seem to want to read for fun. 
So if you look at all the best-seller lists in India, what you'll always find in the best-seller list is exam and professional guides. 
Imagine if you found the SAT guides as the "New York Times" number one seller, month after month. 
And yet, the smartphone revolution was creating readers and writers of a different kind. 
Whether it was on Facebook or WhatsApp, Indians were writing and sharing and reading all kinds of things: terrible jokes, spurious pop history, long, emotional confessions, diatribes against the government. 
And as I read and shared these things, I wondered to myself, "Could I get these writers and these readers, could I turn them into my readers?" 
And so I left my plush corner office and my job as the publisher of India's top publishing company, and I set up on my own. 
I moved into a single large room in a cheap bohemian district of Delhi, with a small team. 
And there, I set up a new kind of publishing house. 
A new kind of publishing house needs a new kind of reader and a new kind of book. 
And so I asked myself, "What would this new reader want? 
Would they prize urgency, relevance, timeliness, directness -- the very qualities they seem to want from their online services, indeed, the qualities they seem to want from life today?" 
I knew that my readers were always on the go. 
I'd have to fit into their lifestyle and schedules. 
Would they actually want to read a 200-page book? 
Or would they want something a little bit more digestible? 
Indians are incredibly value-conscious, especially when it comes to their online reading. 
I knew I had to give them books under a dollar. 
And so my company was formed, and it was born. 
It was a platform where we created a list of stories designed for the smartphone, but it also allowed amateur writers to upload their own stories, so they could be showcased along with the very writers they read and admired. 
And we could also enter into other people's digital platforms. 
So, imagine this: imagine you're a receptionist, you've had a long day at work, you book your cab in your ride-hailing app, it shows up, and you get into your car, and you lie back on your seat, and you put on your app. 
And you find a set of stories waiting for you, timed to your journey. 
Imagine you're a gay young woman, in a relatively conservative city like Lucknow, which lies near Delhi. 
There's no way your parents know about your sexuality. 
They'd completely freak out. 
Would you like lesbian love stories written in Hindi, priced under a dollar, to be read in the privacy of your phone? 
And could I match readers to the events that were taking place around them in real time? 
So we published biographies of very famous politicians after they won big elections. 
When the supreme court decriminalized homosexuality, an LGBTQ collection was waiting on our home page. 
And when India's Toni Morrison, the great writer Mahasweta Devi died, our readers found a short story by her as soon as news hit. 
The idea was to be relevant to every moment of a reader's life. 
Who are our readers? 
They're mostly young men under the age of 30. 
There's someone like Salil, who lives in a city where there isn't a modern bookshop. 
And he comes to our app almost every day. 
There's someone like Manoj, who mostly reads us during the long commute back home. 
And there's someone like Ahmed, who loves our nonfiction that he can read in a single sitting, and that's priced very low. 
Imagine if you're like a young, techie boy in India's Silicon Valley city of Bangalore. 
And one day, you get an in-app notification and it says that your favorite actress has written a sexy short story and it's waiting for you. 
That's how we launched Juggernaut. 
We got a very famous ex-adult star, called Sunny Leone. 
She's India's most Googled person, as it happens. 
And we got her to write us a collection of sexy short stories that we published every night for a week. 
And it was a sensation. 
I mean, no one could believe that we'd asked Sunny Leone to write. 
But she did, and she proved everyone wrong, and she found this immense readership. 
And just as we've redefined what a book is and how a reader behaves, we're rethinking who an author is. 
In our amateur writing platform, we have writers that range from teenagers to housewives. 
And they're writing all kinds of things. 
It starts as small as a poem, an essay, a single short story ... 
Fifty percent of them are returning to the app to write again. 
Take someone like Neeraj. 
He's a middle-aged executive, wife, two kids, a good job. 
And Neeraj loves to read. 
But every time Neeraj read a book that he loved, he was also filled with regret. 
He wondered to himself if he could write, too. 
He was convinced he had stories in his mind. 
But time and real life had happened, and he couldn't really manage it. 
And then he heard about the Juggernaut writer's platform. 
And what he loved about it was that he felt this was a place where he could stand head and shoulders, equally, with the very writers that he most admired. 
And so he began to write. 
And he snatched a minute here, an hour there, in between flights in airports, late at night, when he had a little bit of time on his hands. 
And he wrote this extraordinary story for us. 
He wrote a story about a family of assassins who lived in the winding lanes of Old Delhi. 
We loved it, it was so fresh and original. 
And before Neeraj knew it, he'd not only scored a film deal but also a second contract to write another story. 
Neeraj's story is one of the most read stories on our app. 
My journey is very, very young. 
We're a two-year-old company, and we have a long way to go. 
But we already, and we will by the end of this year, have about half a million stories, many priced at under a dollar. 
Most of our readers love reading and trying out authors they've never, ever heard of before. 
Thirty percent of our home page reads comes out of the writing that comes from our writer's platform. 
By being everywhere, by being accessible and relevant, I hope to make reading a daily habit, as easy and effortless as checking your email, as booking a ticket online or ordering your groceries. 
And as for me, I've discovered that as I entered the six-inch world of the smartphone, my own world just got very, very big. 
Thank you. 
(Applause) 

We all know that saving is important and is something that we should be doing. 
And yet, overall, we're doing less and less of it. 
[The Way We Work] We know what we need to do. 
The question is: How do we do it? 
And that's what I'm here to teach you. 
Your savings behavior isn't a question of how smart you are or how much willpower you have. 
The amount we save depends on the environmental cues around us. 
Let me give you an example. 
We ran a study in which, in one group, we showed people their income on a monthly basis. 
In another group, we showed people their income on a weekly basis. 
And what we found was that people who saw their income on a weekly basis were able to budget better throughout the month. 
Now, it's important to know that we didn't change how much money people were receiving, we just changed the environment in which they understood their income. 
And environmental cues like this have an impact. 
So I'm not going to share tricks with you that you already know. 
I'm not going to tell you how to open up a savings account or how to start saving for your retirement. 
What I am going to share with you is how to bridge this gap from your intentions to save and your actions. 
Are you ready? 
Here's number one: harness the power of pre-commitment. 
Fundamentally, we think about ourselves in two different ways: our present self and our future self. 
In the future, we're perfect. 
In the future, we're going to save for retirement, we're going to lose weight, we're going to call our parents more. 
But we oftentimes forget that our future self is exactly the same person as our present self. 
We know that one of the best times to save is when you get your tax return. 
So we tried an A/B test. 
In the first group, we texted people in early February, hopefully before they even filed for their taxes. 
And we asked them, "If you get a tax refund, what percentage would you like to save?" 
Now this is a really hard question. 
They didn't know if they would receive a tax refund or how much. 
But we asked the question anyway. 
In the second group, we asked people right after they received their refund, "What percentage would you like to save?" 
In that second condition, when people just received their tax refund, they wanted to save about 17 percent of their tax refund. 
But in the condition when we asked people before they even filed their taxes, savings rates increased from 17 percent to 27 percent when we asked in February. 
Why? 
Because you're committing for your future self, and of course your future self can save 27 percent. 
These large changes in savings behavior came from the fact that we changed the decision-making environment. 
We want you to be able to harness that same power. 
So take a moment and think about the ways in which you can sign up your future self for something that you know today will be a little bit hard. 
Sign up for an app that lets you make savings decisions in advance. 
The trick is, you have to have that binding contract. 
Number two: use transition moments to your advantage. 
We did an experiment with a website that helps older adults share their housing. 
We ran two ads on social media, targeted to the same population of 64-year-olds. 
In one group, we said, "Hey, you're getting older. 
Are you ready for retirement? 
House sharing can help." 
In the second group, we got a little bit more specific and said, "You're 64 turning 65. 
Are you ready for retirement? 
House sharing can help." 
What we're doing in that second group is highlighting that a transition is happening. 
All of a sudden, we saw click-through rates, and ultimately sign-up rates, increase when we highlight that. 
In psychology, we call this the "fresh start effect." 
Whether it's the start of a new year or even a new season, your motivation to act increases. 
So right now, put a meeting request on your calendar for the day before your next birthday. 
Identify the one financial thing you most want to do. 
And commit yourself to it. 
The third and final trick: get a handle on small, frequent purchases. 
We've run a few different studies and found that the number one purchase people say they regret, after bank fees, is eating out. 
It's a frequent purchase we make almost every day, and it's death by a thousand cuts. 
A coffee here, a burrito there ... 
It adds up and decreases our ability to save. 
Back when I lived in New York City, I looked at my expenses and saw that I spent over 2,000 dollars on ride-sharing apps. 
It was more than my New York City rent. 
I vowed to make a change. 
And the next month, I spent 2,000 dollars again -- no change, because the information alone didn't change my behavior. 
I didn't change my environment. 
So now that I was 4,000 dollars in the hole, I did two things. 
The first is that I unlinked my credit card from my car-sharing apps. 
Instead, I linked a debit card that only had 300 dollars a month. 
If I needed more, I had to go through the whole process of adding a new card, and we know that every click, every barrier, changes our behavior. 
We aren't machines. 
We don't carry around an abacus every day, adding up what we're spending, in comparison to what we wanted. 
But what our brains are very good at is counting up the number of times we've done something. 
So I gave myself a limit. 
I can only use ride-sharing apps three times a week. 
It forced me to ration my travels. 
I got a handle on my car-sharing expenses to the benefit of my husband, because of the environmental changes that I did. 
So get a handle on whatever that purchase is for you, and change your environment to make it harder to do so. 
Those are my tips for you. 
But I want you to remember one thing. 
As human beings, we can be irrational when it comes to saving and spending and budgeting. 
But luckily, we know this about ourselves, and we can predict how we'll act under certain environments. 
Let's do that with saving. 
Let's change our environment to help our future selves. 

The basic problem with working in an office is you're just not in control of your work environment. 
[The Way We Work] Howdy, my name is Matt, and I'm the CEO of Automattic, the company behind WordPress.com, Jetpack and WooCommerce. 
We're coming up on over 800 employees, and they live everywhere, from California to Alabama, Mississippi, to where I live in Texas. 
They're also in 67 countries. 
Canada, Mexico, India, New Zealand. 
Some of them choose not even to have a home base, they're nomads. 
Whether they are in RVs or traveling through Airbnbs, they are in new places every day, week or month. 
As long as they can find good Wi-Fi, we don't care where they are. 
Our focus on distributed work didn't happen accidentally. 
It was a conscious choice from the very beginning. 
Notice I don't use the word "remote," because it sets up the expectation, that some people are essential and some aren't. 
I use the word "distributed" to describe what we do, where everyone is on an equal playing field. 
I think a distributed workforce is the most effective way to build a company. 
The key is you have to approach it consciously. 
When we started WordPress, many of the first 20 hires were people I'd never met in person. 
But we'd collaborated online, sometimes for years. 
I wanted to continue that for one simple reason. 
I believe that talent and intelligence are equally distributed throughout the world. 
But opportunity is not. 
In Silicon Valley, the big tech companies fish from essentially the same small pond or bay. 
A distributed company can fish from the entire ocean. 
Instead of hiring someone who grew up in Japan but lives in California, you can gain someone who lives, works, wakes up and goes to sleep wherever they are in the world. 
They bring a different understanding of that culture and a different lived experience. 
At the base of the decision to go distributed, there's a desire to give people autonomy over how they do their work. 
Unless you're in a role where specific hours are important, you can make your own schedule. 
Everyone can have a corner office, their windows, the food they want to eat, you can choose when there's music and when there's silence. 
You can choose what temperature the room should be. 
You can save the time you'd spend commuting and put it into things that are important to you. 
A distributed workforce is ideal for a technology company. 
But people often ask me, "This works great for y'all, but what about everyone else?" 
If you have an office, you can do a few things to build distributed capability. 
First: document everything. 
In an office, it's easy to make decisions in the moment, in the kitchen, in the hall. 
But if people work remotely and some members of the team are having those conversations they don't have access to, they'll see these decisions being made without understanding the why. 
Always leave a trail of where you were and what you were thinking about. 
This allows others to pick up where you left off. 
It allows people in different time zones to interact, it's also great to think about as an organization evolves, people leaving and people joining. 
Try to have as much communication as possible online. 
When everything's shared and public, it allows new people to catch up quickly. 
You also need to find the right tools. 
There are so many apps and services that help with day-to-day communication, video conferencing, project management. 
The things that changed how you work probably aren't objects anymore. 
They're things you access through your computer. 
So experiment with different tools that enable collaboration, see what works. 
Create productive, face-to-face time. 
In a traditional office, you're in the same place 48 weeks out of the year and you might have three or four weeks apart. 
We try to flip that: we come together for short, intense bursts. 
Once a year we do a grand meet-up where the entire company comes together for a week. 
It's half-work, half-play. 
The primary goal is connecting people. 
We want to make sure everyone's aligned and on the same page, and they have a deeper connection with their colleagues. 
When they work together the rest of the year, they can bring together that understanding and empathy. 
And the final practice: give people the flexibility to make their own work environment. 
Every person at Automattic has a co-working stipend that they can put towards a co-working space or just to buy coffee, so they don't get kicked out of the coffee shop. 
One group in Seattle decided to pool their stipends together and rented a workspace on a fishing pier. 
Each person who joins the company gets a home-office stipend. 
This is money they can invest in getting the right chair, monitor, the right desk setup, so they can have the most productive environment for them. 
Today, there are just a few companies that are distributed first. 
In a decade or two, I predict that 90 percent of companies that are going to be changing the course of the world are going to function this way. 
They will evolve to be distributed first, or they'll be replaced by those that are. 
As you think about what you're going to build next, consider how you can tap into global talent, give people autonomy to live and work where they feel they should and still participate fully in whatever it is that you're creating together. 

Computers used to be as big as a room. 
But now they fit in your pocket, on your wrist and can even be implanted inside of your body. 
How cool is that? 
And this has been enabled by the miniaturization of transistors, which are the tiny switches in the circuits at the heart of our computers. 
And it's been achieved through decades of development and breakthroughs in science and engineering and of billions of dollars of investment. 
But it's given us vast amounts of computing, huge amounts of memory and the digital revolution that we all experience and enjoy today. 
But the bad news is, we're about to hit a digital roadblock, as the rate of miniaturization of transistors is slowing down. 
And this is happening at exactly the same time as our innovation in software is continuing relentlessly with artificial intelligence and big data. 
And our devices regularly perform facial recognition or augment our reality or even drive cars down our treacherous, chaotic roads. 
It's amazing. 
But if we don't keep up with the appetite of our software, we could reach a point in the development of our technology where the things that we could do with software could, in fact, be limited by our hardware. 
We've all experienced the frustration of an old smartphone or tablet grinding slowly to a halt over time under the ever-increasing weight of software updates and new features. 
And it worked just fine when we bought it not so long ago. 
But the hungry software engineers have eaten up all the hardware capacity over time. 
The semiconductor industry is very well aware of this and is working on all sorts of creative solutions, such as going beyond transistors to quantum computing or even working with transistors in alternative architectures such as neural networks to make more robust and efficient circuits. 
But these approaches will take quite some time, and we're really looking for a much more immediate solution to this problem. 
The reason why the rate of miniaturization of transistors is slowing down is due to the ever-increasing complexity of the manufacturing process. 
The transistor used to be a big, bulky device, until the invent of the integrated circuit based on pure crystalline silicon wafers. 
And after 50 years of continuous development, we can now achieve transistor features dimensions down to 10 nanometers. 
You can fit more than a billion transistors in a single square millimeter of silicon. 
And to put this into perspective: a human hair is 100 microns across. 
A red blood cell, which is essentially invisible, is eight microns across, and you can place 12 across the width of a human hair. 
But a transistor, in comparison, is much smaller, at a tiny fraction of a micron across. 
You could place more than 260 transistors across a single red blood cell or more than 3,000 across the width of a human hair. 
It really is incredible nanotechnology in your pocket right now. 
And besides the obvious benefit of being able to place more, smaller transistors on a chip, smaller transistors are faster switches, and smaller transistors are also more efficient switches. 
So this combination has given us lower cost, higher performance and higher efficiency electronics that we all enjoy today. 
To manufacture these integrated circuits, the transistors are built up layer by layer, on a pure crystalline silicon wafer. 
And in an oversimplified sense, every tiny feature of the circuit is projected onto the surface of the silicon wafer and recorded in a light-sensitive material and then etched through the light-sensitive material to leave the pattern in the underlying layers. 
And this process has been dramatically improved over the years to give the electronics performance we have today. 
But as the transistor features get smaller and smaller, we're really approaching the physical limitations of this manufacturing technique. 
The latest systems for doing this patterning have become so complex that they reportedly cost more than 100 million dollars each. 
And semiconductor factories contain dozens of these machines. 
So people are seriously questioning: Is this approach long-term viable? 
But we believe we can do this chip manufacturing in a totally different and much more cost-effective way using molecular engineering and mimicking nature down at the nanoscale dimensions of our transistors. 
As I said, the conventional manufacturing takes every tiny feature of the circuit and projects it onto the silicon. 
But if you look at the structure of an integrated circuit, the transistor arrays, many of the features are repeated millions of times. 
It's a highly periodic structure. 
So we want to take advantage of this periodicity in our alternative manufacturing technique. 
We want to use self-assembling materials to naturally form the periodic structures that we need for our transistors. 
We do this with the materials, then the materials do the hard work of the fine patterning, rather than pushing the projection technology to its limits and beyond. 
Self-assembly is seen in nature in many different places, from lipid membranes to cell structures, so we do know it can be a robust solution. 
If it's good enough for nature, it should be good enough for us. 
So we want to take this naturally occurring, robust self-assembly and use it for the manufacturing of our semiconductor technology. 
One type of self-assemble material -- it's called a block co-polymer -- consists of two polymer chains just a few tens of nanometers in length. 
But these chains hate each other. 
They repel each other, very much like oil and water or my teenage son and daughter. 
(Laughter) But we cruelly bond them together, creating an inbuilt frustration in the system, as they try to separate from each other. 
And in the bulk material, there are billions of these, and the similar components try to stick together, and the opposing components try to separate from each other at the same time. 
And this has a built-in frustration, a tension in the system. 
So it moves around, it squirms until a shape is formed. 
And the natural self-assembled shape that is formed is nanoscale, it's regular, it's periodic, and it's long range, which is exactly what we need for our transistor arrays. 
So we can use molecular engineering to design different shapes of different sizes and of different periodicities. 
So for example, if we take a symmetrical molecule, where the two polymer chains are similar length, the natural self-assembled structure that is formed is a long, meandering line, very much like a fingerprint. 
And the width of the fingerprint lines and the distance between them is determined by the lengths of our polymer chains but also the level of built-in frustration in the system. 
And we can even create more elaborate structures if we use unsymmetrical molecules, where one polymer chain is significantly shorter than the other. 
And the self-assembled structure that forms in this case is with the shorter chains forming a tight ball in the middle, and it's surrounded by the longer, opposing polymer chains, forming a natural cylinder. 
And the size of this cylinder and the distance between the cylinders, the periodicity, is again determined by how long we make the polymer chains and the level of built-in frustration. 
So in other words, we're using molecular engineering to self-assemble nanoscale structures that can be lines or cylinders the size and periodicity of our design. 
We're using chemistry, chemical engineering, to manufacture the nanoscale features that we need for our transistors. 
But the ability to self-assemble these structures only takes us half of the way, because we still need to position these structures where we want the transistors in the integrated circuit. 
But we can do this relatively easily using wide guide structures that pin down the self-assembled structures, anchoring them in place and forcing the rest of the self-assembled structures to lie parallel, aligned with our guide structure. 
For example, if we want to make a fine, 40-nanometer line, which is very difficult to manufacture with conventional projection technology, we can manufacture a 120-nanometer guide structure with normal projection technology, and this structure will align three of the 40-nanometer lines in between. 
So the materials are doing the most difficult fine patterning. 
And we call this whole approach "directed self-assembly." 
The challenge with directed self-assembly is that the whole system needs to align almost perfectly, because any tiny defect in the structure could cause a transistor failure. 
And because there are billions of transistors in our circuit, we need an almost molecularly perfect system. 
But we're going to extraordinary measures to achieve this, from the cleanliness of our chemistry to the careful processing of these materials in the semiconductor factory to remove even the smallest nanoscopic defects. 
So directed self-assembly is an exciting new disruptive technology, but it is still in the development stage. 
But we're growing in confidence that we could, in fact, introduce it to the semiconductor industry as a revolutionary new manufacturing process in just the next few years. 
And if we can do this, if we're successful, we'll be able to continue with the cost-effective miniaturization of transistors, continue with the spectacular expansion of computing and the digital revolution. 
And what's more, this could even be the dawn of a new era of molecular manufacturing. 
How cool is that? 
Thank you. 
(Applause) 

It’s 6:30 in the morning, and Kristen is wheeling her prostate patient into the OR. 
She's a resident, a surgeon in training. 
It’s her job to learn. 
Today, she’s really hoping to do some of the nerve-sparing, extremely delicate dissection that can preserve erectile function. 
That'll be up to the attending surgeon, though, but he's not there yet. 
She and the team put the patient under, and she leads the initial eight-inch incision in the lower abdomen. 
Once she’s got that clamped back, she tells the nurse to call the attending. 
He arrives, gowns up, And from there on in, their four hands are mostly in that patient -- with him guiding but Kristin leading the way. 
When the prostates out (and, yes, he let Kristen do a little nerve sparing), he rips off his scrubs. 
He starts to do paperwork. 
Kristen closes the patient by 8:15, with a junior resident looking over her shoulder. 
And she lets him do the final line of sutures. 
Kristen feels great. 
Patient’s going to be fine, and no doubt she’s a better surgeon than she was at 6:30. 
Now this is extreme work. 
But Kristin’s learning to do her job the way that most of us do: watching an expert for a bit, getting involved in easy, safe parts of the work and progressing to riskier and harder tasks as they guide and decide she’s ready. 
My whole life I’ve been fascinated by this kind of learning. 
It feels elemental, part of what makes us human. 
It has different names: apprenticeship, coaching, mentorship, on the job training. 
In surgery, it’s called “see one, do one, teach one.” But the process is the same, and it’s been the main path to skill around the globe for thousands of years. 
Right now, we’re handling AI in a way that blocks that path. 
We’re sacrificing learning in our quest for productivity. 
I found this first in surgery while I was at MIT, but now I’ve got evidence it’s happening all over, in very different industries and with very different kinds of AI. 
If we do nothing, millions of us are going to hit a brick wall as we try to learn to deal with AI. 
Let’s go back to surgery to see how. 
Fast forward six months. 
It’s 6:30am again, and Kristen is wheeling another prostate patient in, but this time to the robotic OR. 
The attending leads attaching a four-armed, thousand-pound robot to the patient. 
They both rip off their scrubs, head to control consoles 10 or 15 feet away, and Kristen just watches. 
The robot allows the attending to do the whole procedure himself, so he basically does. 
He knows she needs practice. 
He wants to give her control. 
But he also knows she’d be slower and make more mistakes, and his patient comes first. 
So Kristin has no hope of getting anywhere near those nerves during this rotation. 
She’ll be lucky if she operates more than 15 minutes during a four-hour procedure. 
And she knows that when she slips up, he’ll tap a touch screen, and she’ll be watching again, feeling like a kid in the corner with a dunce cap. 
Like all the studies of robots and work I’ve done in the last eight years, I started this one with a big, open question: How do we learn to work with intelligent machines? 
To find out, I spent two and a half years observing dozens of residents and surgeons doing traditional and robotic surgery, interviewing them and in general hanging out with the residents as they tried to learn. 
I covered 18 of the top US teaching hospitals, and the story was the same. 
Most residents were in Kristen's shoes. 
They got to “see one” plenty, but the “do one” was barely available. 
So they couldn’t struggle, and they weren’t learning. 
This was important news for surgeons, but I needed to know how widespread it was: Where else was using AI blocking learning on the job? 
To find out, I’ve connected with a small but growing group of young researchers who’ve done boots-on-the-ground studies of work involving AI in very diverse settings like start-ups, policing, investment banking and online education. 
Like me, they spent at least a year and many hundreds of hours observing, interviewing and often working side-by-side with the people they studied. 
We shared data, and I looked for patterns. 
No matter the industry, the work, the AI, the story was the same. 
Organizations were trying harder and harder to get results from AI, and they were peeling learners away from expert work as they did it. 
Start-up managers were outsourcing their customer contact. 
Cops had to learn to deal with crime forecasts without experts support. 
Junior bankers were getting cut out of complex analysis, and professors had to build online courses without help. 
And the effect of all of this was the same as in surgery. 
Learning on the job was getting much harder. 
This can’t last. 
McKinsey estimates that between half a billion and a billion of us are going to have to adapt to AI in our daily work by 2030. 
And we’re assuming that on-the-job learning will be there for us as we try. 
Accenture’s latest workers survey showed that most workers learned key skills on the job, not in formal training. 
So while we talk a lot about its potential future impact, the aspect of AI that may matter most right now is that we’re handling it in a way that blocks learning on the job just when we need it most. 
Now across all our sites, a small minority found a way to learn. 
They did it by breaking and bending rules. 
Approved methods weren’t working, so they bent and broke rules to get hands-on practice with experts. 
In my setting, residents got involved in robotic surgery in medical school at the expense of their generalist education. 
And they spent hundreds of extra hours with simulators and recordings of surgery, when you were supposed to learn in the OR. 
And maybe most importantly, they found ways to struggle in live procedures with limited expert supervision. 
I call all this “shadow learning,” because it bends the rules and learner’s do it out of the limelight. 
And everyone turns a blind eye because it gets results. 
Remember, these are the star pupils of the bunch. 
Now, obviously, this is not OK, and it’s not sustainable. 
No one should have to risk getting fired to learn the skills they need to do their job. 
But we do need to learn from these people. 
They took serious risks to learn. 
They understood they needed to protect struggle and challenge in their work so that they could push themselves to tackle hard problems right near the edge of their capacity. 
They also made sure there was an expert nearby to offer pointers and to backstop against catastrophe. 
Let’s build this combination of struggle and expert support into each AI implementation. 
Here’s one clear example I could get of this on the ground. 
Before robots, if you were a bomb disposal technician, you dealt with an IED by walking up to it. 
A junior officer was hundreds of feet away, so could only watch and help if you decided it was safe and invited them downrange. 
Now you sit side-by-side in a bomb-proof truck. 
You both watched the video feed. 
They control a distant robot, and you guide the work out loud. 
Trainees learn better than they did before robots. 
We can scale this to surgery, start-ups, policing, investment banking, online education and beyond. 
The good news is we’ve got new tools to do it. 
The internet and the cloud mean we don’t always need one expert for every trainee, for them to be physically near each other or even to be in the same organization. 
And we can build AI to help: to coach learners as they struggle, to coach experts as they coach and to connect those two groups in smart ways. 
There are people at work on systems like this, but they’ve been mostly focused on formal training. 
And the deeper crisis is in on-the-job learning. 
We must do better. 
Today’s problems demand we do better to create work that takes full advantage of AI’s amazing capabilities while enhancing our skills as we do it. 
That’s the kind of future I dreamed of as a kid. 
And the time to create it is now. 
Thank you. 
(Applause) 

Do you hear that? 
Do you know what that is? 
Silence. 
The sound of silence. 
Simon and Garfunkel wrote a song about it. 
But silence is a pretty rare commodity these days, and we're all paying a price for it in terms of our health -- a surprisingly big price, as it turns out. 
Luckily, there are things we can do right now, both individually and as a society, to better protect our health and give us more of the benefits of the sounds of silence. 
I assume that most of you know that too much noise is bad for your hearing. 
Whenever you leave a concert or a bar and you have that ringing in your ears, you can be certain that you have done some damage to your hearing, likely permanent. 
And that's very important. 
However, noise affects our health in many different ways beyond hearing. 
They're less well-known, but they're just as dangerous as the auditory effects. 
So what do we mean when we talk about noise? 
Well, noise is defined as unwanted sound, and as such, both has a physical component, the sound, and a psychological component, the circumstances that make the sound unwanted. 
A very good example is a rock concert. 
A person attending the rock concert, being exposed to 100 decibels, does not think of the music as noise. 
This person likes the band, and even paid a hundred dollars for the ticket, so no matter how loud the music, this person doesn't think of it as noise. 
In contrast, think of a person living three blocks away from the concert hall. 
That person is trying to read a book, but cannot concentrate because of the music. 
And although the sound pressure levels are much lower in this situation, this person still thinks of the music as noise, and it may trigger reactions that can, in the long run, have health consequences. 
So why are quiet spaces so important? 
Because noise affects our health in so many ways beyond hearing. 
However, it's becoming increasingly difficult to find quiet spaces in times of constantly increasing traffic, growing urbanization, construction sites, air-conditioning units, leaf blowers, lawnmowers, outdoor concerts and bars, personal music players, and your neighbors partying until 3am. 
Whew! 
In 2011, the World Health Organization estimated that 1.6 million healthy life years are lost every year due to exposure to environmental noise in the Western European member states alone. 
One important effect of noise is that it disturbs communication. 
You may have to raise your voice to be understood. 
In extreme cases, you may even have to pause the conversation. 
It's also more likely to be misunderstood in a noisy environment. 
These are all likely reasons why studies have found that children who attend schools in noisy areas are more likely to lag behind their peers in academic performance. 
Another very important health effect of noise is the increased risk for cardiovascular disease in those who are exposed to relevant noise levels for prolonged periods of time. 
Noise is stress, especially if we have little or no control over it. 
Our body excretes stress hormones like adrenaline and cortisol that lead to changes in the composition of our blood and in the structure of our blood vessels, which have been shown to be stiffer after a single night of noise exposure. 
Epidemiological studies show associations between the noise exposure and an increased risk for high blood pressure, heart attacks and stroke, and although the overall risk increases are relatively small, this still constitutes a major public health problem because noise is so ubiquitous, and so many people are exposed to relevant noise levels. 
A recent study found that US society could save 3.9 billion dollars each year by lowering environmental noise exposure by five decibels, just by saving costs for treating cardiovascular disease. 
There are other diseases like cancer, diabetes and obesity that have been linked to noise exposure, but we do not have enough evidence yet to, in fact, conclude that these diseases are caused by the noise. 
Yet another important effect of noise is sleep disturbance. 
Sleep is a very active mechanism that recuperates us and prepares us for the next wake period. 
A quiet bedroom is a cornerstone of what sleep researchers call "a good sleep hygiene." 
And our auditory system has a watchman function. 
It's constantly monitoring our environment for threats, even while we're sleeping. 
So noise in the bedroom can cause a delay in the time it takes us to fall asleep, it can wake us up during the night, and it can prevent our blood pressure from going down during the night. 
We have the hypothesis that if these noise-induced sleep disturbances continue for months and years, then an increased risk for cardiovascular disease is likely the consequence. 
However, we are often not aware of these noise-induced sleep disturbances, because we are unconscious while we're sleeping. 
In the past, we've done studies on the effects of traffic noise on sleep, and research subjects would often wake up in the morning and say, "Ah, I had a wonderful night, I fell asleep right away, never really woke up." 
When we would go back to the physiological signals we had recorded during the night, we would often see numerous awakenings and a severely fragmented sleep structure. 
These awakenings were too brief for the subjects to regain consciousness and to remember them during the next morning, but they may nevertheless have a profound impact on how restful our sleep is. 
So when is loud too loud? 
A good sign of too loud is once you start changing your behavior. 
You may have to raise your voice to be understood, or you increase the volume of your TV. 
You're avoiding outside areas, or you're closing your window. 
You're moving your bedroom to the basement of the house, or you even have sound insulation installed. 
Many people will move away to less noisy areas, but obviously not everybody can afford that. 
So what can we do right now to improve our sound environment and to better protect our health? 
Well, first of all, if something's too loud, speak up. 
For example, many owners of movie theaters seem to think that only people hard of hearing are still going to the movies. 
If you complain about the noise and nothing happens, demand a refund and leave. 
That's the language that managers typically do understand. 
Also, talk to your children about the health effects of noise and that listening to loud music today will have consequences when they're older. 
You can also move your bedroom to the quiet side of the house, where your own building shields you from road traffic noise. 
If you're looking to rent or buy a new place, make low noise a priority. 
Visit the property during different times of the day and talk to the neighbors about noise. 
You can wear noise-canceling headphones when you're traveling or if your office has high background noise levels. 
In general, seek out quiet spaces, especially on the weekend or when you're on vacation. 
Allow your system to wind down. 
I, very appropriately for this talk, attended a noise conference in Japan four years ago. 
When I returned to the United States and entered the airport, a wall of sound hit me. 
This tells you that we don't realize anymore the constant degree of noise pollution we're exposed to and how much we could profit from more quiet spaces. 
What else can we do about noise? 
Well, very much like a carbon footprint, we all have a noise footprint, and there are things we can do to make that noise footprint smaller. 
For example, don't start mowing your lawn at 7am on a Saturday morning. 
Your neighbors will thank you. 
Or use a rake instead of a leaf blower. 
In general, noise reduction at the source makes the most sense, so whenever you're looking to buy a new car, air-conditioning unit, blender, you name it, make low noise a priority. 
Many manufacturers will list the noise levels their devices generate, and some even advertise with them. 
Use that information. 
Many people think that stronger noise regulation and enforcement are good ideas, even obvious solutions, perhaps, but it's not as easy as you may think, because many of the activities that generate noise also generate revenue. 
Think about an airport and all the business that is associated with it. 
Our research tells politicians at what noise level they can expect a certain health effect, and that helps inform better noise policy. 
Robert Koch supposedly once said, "One day, mankind will fight noise as relentlessly as cholera and the pest." 
I think we're there, and I hope that we will win this fight, and when we do, we can all have a nice, quiet celebration. 
(Laughter) Thank you. 
(Applause) 

About two years ago, I got a phone call that changed my life. 
"Hey, this is your cousin Hassen." 
I froze. 
You see, I have well over 30 first cousins, but I didn't know anybody named Hassen. 
It turned out that Hassen was actually my mom's cousin and had just arrived in Montreal as a refugee. 
And over the next few months, I would have three more relatives coming to Canada to apply for asylum with little more than the clothes on their back. 
And in the two years since that phone call, my life has completely changed. 
I left academia and now lead a diverse team of technologists, researchers and refugees that is developing customized self-help resources for newcomers. 
We want to help them overcome language, cultural and other barriers that make them feel like they've lost control over their own lives. 
And we feel that AI can help restore the rights and the dignity that many people lose when seeking help. 
My family's refugee experience is not unique. 
According to the UNHCR, every minute, 20 people are newly displaced by climate change, economic crisis and social and political instability. 
And it was while volunteering at a local YMCA shelter that my cousin Hassen and other relatives were sent to that we saw and learned to appreciate how much effort and coordination resettlement requires. 
When you first arrive, you need to find a lawyer and fill out legal documents within two weeks. 
You also need to schedule a medical exam with a pre-authorized physician, just so that you can apply for a work permit. 
And you need to start looking for a place to live before you receive any sort of social assistance. 
With thousands fleeing the United States to seek asylum in Canada over the past few years, we quickly saw what it looks like when there are more people who need help than there are resources to help them. 
Social services doesn't scale quickly, and even if communities do their best to help more people with limited resources, newcomers end up spending more time waiting in limbo, not knowing where to turn. 
In Montreal, for example, despite millions of dollars being spent to support resettlement efforts, nearly 50 percent of newcomers still don't know that there are free resources that exist to help them with everything from filling out paperwork to finding a job. 
The challenge is not that this information doesn't exist. 
On the contrary, those in need are often bombarded with so much information that it's difficult to make sense of it all. 
"Don't give me more information, just tell me what to do," was a sentiment we heard over and over again. 
And it reflects how insanely difficult it could be to get your bearings when you first arrive in a new country. 
Hell, I struggled with the same issues when I got to Montreal, and I have a PhD. 
(Laughter) As another member of our team, himself also a refugee, put it: "In Canada, a SIM card is more important than food, because we will not die from hunger." 
But getting access to the right resources and information can be the difference between life and death. 
Let me say that again: getting access to the right resources and information can be the difference between life and death. 
In order to address these issues, we built Atar, the first-ever AI-powered virtual advocate that guides you step-by-step through your first week of arriving in a new city. 
Just tell Atar what you need help with. 
Atar will then ask you some basic questions to understand your unique circumstances and determine your eligibility for resources. 
For example: Do you have a place to stay tonight? 
If not, would you prefer an all-women's shelter? 
Do you have children? 
Atar will then generate a custom, step-by-step to-do list that tells you everything that you need to know, from where to go, how to get there, what to bring with you and what to expect. 
You can ask a question at any time, and if Atar doesn't have an answer, you'll be connected with a real person who does. 
But what's most exciting is that we help humanitarian and service organizations collect the data and the analytics that's necessary to understand the changing needs of newcomers in real time. 
That's a game changer. 
We've already partnered with the UNHCR to provide this technology in Canada, and in our work have conducted campaigns in Arabic, English, French, Creole and Spanish. 
When we talk about the issue of refugees, we often focus on the official statistic of 65.8 million forcibly displaced worldwide. 
But the reality is much greater than that. 
By 2050, there will be an additional 140 million people who are at risk of being displaced due to environmental degradation. 
And today -- that is today -- there are nearly one billion people who already live in illegal settlements and slums. 
Resettlement and integration is one of the greatest challenges of our time. 
and our hope is that Atar can provide every single newcomer an advocate. 
Our hope is that Atar can amplify existing efforts and alleviate pressure on a social safety net that's already stretched beyond imagination. 
But what's most important to us is that our work helps restore the rights and the dignity that refugees lose throughout resettlement and integration by giving them the resources that they need in order to help themselves. 
Thank you. 
(Applause) 

I come from a family of five brothers, all scientists and engineers. 
A few years ago, I sent them the following email: "Dear brothers, I hope this message finds you well. 
I am emailing to let you know that I'm dropping out of my master's program in engineering to pursue a career as a full-time musician. 
All that I ask from you is not to worry about me." 
Brother number one replied. 
He was encouraging but a bit skeptical. 
He said, "I wish you the best of luck. 
You're going to need it." 
(Laughter) Brother number two was a little bit more skeptical. 
He said, "Don't do it! 
This will be the worst mistake of your life. 
Find a real career." 
(Laughter) Well, the rest of my brothers were so enthusiastic about my decision, they didn't even respond. 
(Laughter) I know that the skepticism coming from my brothers is out of care and concern for me. 
They were worried. 
They thought it would be difficult to make it as an artist, that it will be a challenge. 
And you know what? They were right. 
It is such a challenge to be a full-time artist. 
I have so many friends who need to have a second job as a plan B in order to pay for the bills, except that plan B sometimes becomes their plan A. 
And it's not just my friends and I who experience this. 
The US Census Bureau states that only 10 percent of art school graduates end up working as full-time artists. 
The other 90 percent, they change careers, they work in marketing, sales, education and other fields. 
But this is not news, right? 
We almost expect the artist to be a struggling artist. 
But why should we expect that? 
I read an article in the "Huffington Post" saying that four years ago, the European Union began the world's largest ever arts funding initiative. 
Creative Europe will give 2.4 billion dollars to over 300,000 artists. 
In contrast, the US budget for our National Endowment for the Arts, the largest single funder for the arts across the United States, is merely 146 million dollars. 
To put things into perspective, the US budget for the military marching bands alone is almost twice as much as the entire NEA. 
Another striking image comes from Brendan McMahon for the "Huffington Post," saying that out of the one trillion dollar budget for military and defense-related spending, if only 0.05 percent were allocated to the arts, we would be able to pay for 20 full-time symphony orchestras at 20 million dollars apiece, and give over 80,000 artists an annual salary of 50,000 dollars each. 
If that's only 0.05 percent, imagine what a full one percent could do. 
Now, I know we live in a capitalist society, and profits matter a lot. 
So let's look at it from a financial angle, shall we? 
The US nonprofit arts industry generates more than 166 billion dollars in economic activity, it employs 5.7 million people and it returns 12.6 billion dollars in tax revenue. 
But this is only a financial angle, right? 
We all know that the arts is way more than just an economic value. 
The arts brings meaning to life. 
It's the spirit of our culture. 
It brings people together and it supports creativity and social cohesion. 
But if the arts contributes this much to our economy, why then do we still invest so little in arts and artists? 
Why do more than 80 percent of our schools nationwide still experience budget cuts in arts education programs? 
What is it about the value of arts and artists that we still don't understand? 
I believe the system is flawed and far from being fair, and I want to help change that. 
I want to live in a society where artists are more valued and have more cultural and financial support so they can focus on creating arts instead of being forced to drive Ubers or take corporate jobs they'd rather not have. 
There are other sources of income for artists, however. 
There are private foundations, grants and patrons who give money, except a vast majority of artists don't know about these opportunities. 
On one side you have institutions and people with money. 
On the other side you have artists seeking funding, but the artists don't know about the people with the money, and the people with the money don't necessarily know about the artists out there. 
This is why I am very excited to share "Grantpa," an online platform that uses technology to match artists with grants and funding opportunities in a way that is easy, fast and less intimidating. 
Grantpa is only one step towards solving an existing problem of funding inequality, but we need to work collectively on multiple fronts to reevaluate how we view the artists in our society. 
Do we think of arts as a luxury or a necessity? 
Do we understand what goes on in the day-to-day life of an artist, or do we still believe that artists, no matter how struggling they are, are happy simply because they're following their passion? 
In a few years, I plan to send my brothers the following email: "Dear brothers, I hope this message finds you well. 
I am emailing to let you know that I am doing great and so are hundreds of thousands of artists who are being valued more culturally and financially and getting enough funding to focus on their crafts and create more art. 
I appreciate all of your support. 
Couldn't have done it without you." 
Thank you. 
(Applause) 

Let's just get started here. 
Okay, just a moment. 
(Whirring) All right. 
(Laughter) Oh, sorry. 
(Music) (Beatboxing) Thank you. 
(Applause) 

Last summer, I was hiking through the Austrian mountains. 
And there, on top, I saw this beautiful, stone, remote hut, and it had solar panels on it. 
And every time I see solar panels, I get very enthusiastic. 
It's this technology that takes sunlight, which is free and available, and turns that into electricity. 
So this hut, in the middle of nowhere, on a beautiful location, was self-sufficient. 
But why do solar panels always have to be so ugly? 
(Laughter) My name is Marjan Van Aubel and I'm a solar designer. 
I work in the triangle of design, sustainability and technology. 
I strive for extreme efficiency, meaning that I develop materials that expand in size or work with solar cells that use the properties of colors to generate electricity. 
My work is in museums all over the world, such as MoMA. 
And, I mean, it all went quite well, but it always felt that something was missing. 
And it was, until I read the book called the "Solar Revolution," where it says that within one hour we receive enough sunlight to provide the world with enough electricity for an entire year. 
One hour. 
And since then, I realized I just want to focus on solar. 
Scientists all over the world have been focusing on making solar panels more efficient and cheaper. 
So the price of solar has dropped enormously. 
And this is because China started producing them on a large scale. 
And also their efficiency has increased a lot. 
They now even have an efficiency of 44.5 percent. 
But if you think about the image of solar cells, it's kind of stayed the same for the last 60 years. 
It's still this technology just stacked onto something. 
And solar cells need to be much better integrated into our environment. 
Climate change is the biggest problem of our time. 
And we can't rely on the others -- the government, the engineers -- to make positive changes. 
We all can contribute towards change. 
Like I said, I'm a designer and I would like to change things through design. 
Let me give you some examples of my work. 
I'm collaborating with Swarovski, the crystal company. 
And if you cut crystals in a certain way, you are able to bend and direct the light onto a certain place. 
So I use these crystals to focus the light onto a solar panel, making them more efficient, but using aesthetics. 
So you take the solar crystal with you in the light, there's a battery in the solar cell, you put it in a docking station and you are able to power these chandeliers. 
So you're literally bringing the light indoors. 
I got completely hooked on solar when I came across this technology called dye-sensitized solar cells, colored solar cells, and they are based on photosynthesis in plants. 
Where the green chlorophyl converts light into sugar for plants, these cells convert light into electricity. 
The best thing is, they even work indoors. 
So different colors have different efficiency, depending on their place on the color spectrum. 
So, for example, red is more efficient than blue. 
So if I hear this as a designer: a colored surface, a glass colored surface, color that's mostly just used for esthetics, now gets an extra function and is able to harvest electricity, I think, where can we apply this, then? 
This is Current Table, where the whole tabletop consists of these colored solar cells. 
There are batteries in the legs where you can charge your phone through USB ports. 
And in my work, it's always very important, the balance between efficiency and aesthetics. 
So that's why the table is orange, because it is a very stable color for indoors. 
And this is always the most asked question I get: "OK, great, but how many phones can I charge from this, then?" 
And before I go to this complicated answer of like, "Well, where is the table, does it have enough light, is it next to a window?" 
The table now has sensors that read the light intensity of the room. 
So through an app we developed you can literally follow how much light it's getting, and how full the battery is. 
I'm actually proud, because yesterday we installed a table at Stichting Doen's offices in Amsterdam and, right at this moment, our Queen Maxima is charging a phone from this table. 
It's cool. 
(Applause) So the more surface you have, the more energy you can harvest. 
These are Current Windows, where we replaced all windows in a gallery in London, in Soho, with this modern version of stained glass. 
So people from the street could come and charge their phones through the window ledges. 
So I'm giving extra functions to objects. 
A window doesn't have to be just a window anymore. 
It can also function as a little power station. 
So, here I am, talking about how much I love solar, but I don't have solar panels on my roof. 
I live in the center of Amsterdam, I don't own the house and it's a monument, so it's not possible and not allowed. 
So how can you make solar cells more accessible and for everyone, and not only for the people that can afford a sustainable lifestyle? 
We now have the opportunity to integrate solar on the place where we directly need it. 
And there are so many amazing technologies out there. 
If I look around now, I see every surface as an opportunity. 
For example, I was driving in the train through the Westland, the area in the Netherlands with all the greenhouses. 
There I saw all this glass and thought, what if we integrate those with transparent solar glass? 
What if we integrate traditional farming that requires a lot of energy together with high-tech and combine those? 
With this idea in mind, I created Power Plant. 
I had a team of architects and engineers, but let me first explain how it works. 
We use transparent solar glass to power its indoor climate. 
We use hydroponics that pumps around nutrified water, saving 90 percent of water usage. 
By stacking up in layers, you are able to grow more yield per square meter. 
Extra light, besides sunlight, coming from these colored LED lights also enhances plant growth. 
As more and more people will live in big cities, by placing Power Plants on the rooftops you don't have to fly it in from the other side of the world, you are able to grow it on the location itself. 
Well, the big dream is to build these in off-grid places -- where there's no access to water, electricity -- as an independent ecosystem. 
For this year's Design Biennial, I created the first four-meter high model of the power plant, so you could come in and experience how plants grow. 
So it's a double harvest of sunlight, so both for the solar cells and for the plants. 
It's like a future botanical garden, where we celebrate all these modern technologies. 
And the biggest compliment I got was, "But where are the solar panels?" 
And that's when I think design really works, when it becomes invisible and you don't notice it. 
I believe in solar democracy: solar energy for everyone, everywhere. 
My aim is to make all surfaces productive. 
I want to build houses where all the windows, curtains, walls, even floors are harvesting electricity. 
Think about this on a big scale: in cities, there are so many surfaces. 
The sun is still available for everyone. 
And by integrating solar on the place where we need it, we now have the opportunity to make solar cells accessible for everyone. 
I want to bring solar close to the people with you, but beautiful and well designed. 
Thank you. 

Chris Anderson: Shep, thank you so much for coming. 
I think your plane landed literally two hours ago in Vancouver. 
Such a treat to have you. 
So, talk us through how do you get from Einstein's equation to a black hole? 
Sheperd Doeleman: Over 100 years ago, Einstein came up with this geometric theory of gravity which deforms space-time. 
So, matter deforms space-time, and then space-time tells matter in turn how to move around it. 
And you can get enough matter into a small enough region that it punctures space-time, and that even light can't escape, the force of gravity keeps even light inside. 
CA: And so, before that, the reason the Earth moves around the Sun is not because the Sun is pulling the Earth as we think, but it's literally changed the shape of space so that we just sort of fall around the Sun. 
SD: Exactly, the geometry of space-time tells the Earth how to move around the Sun. 
You're almost seeing a black hole puncture through space-time, and when it goes so deeply in, then there's a point at which light orbits the black hole. 
CA: And so that's, I guess, is what's happening here. 
This is not an image, this is a computer simulation of what we always thought, like, the event horizon around the black hole. 
SD: Until last week, we had no idea what a black hole really looked like. 
The best we could do were simulations like this in supercomputers, but even here you see this ring of light, which is the orbit of photons. 
That's where photons literally move around the black hole, and around that is this hot gas that's drawn to the black hole, and it's hot because of friction. 
CA: A few years ago, you embarked on this mission to try and actually image one of these things. 
And I guess you took -- you focused on this galaxy way out there. 
Tell us about this galaxy. 
SD: This is the galaxy -- we're going to zoom into the galaxy M87, it's 55 million light-years away. 
CA: Fifty-five million. 
SD: Which is a long way. 
And at its heart, there's a six-and-a-half-billion- solar-mass black hole. 
That's hard for us to really fathom, right? 
Six and a half billion suns compressed into a single point. 
And it's governing some of the energetics of the center of this galaxy. 
CA: But even though that thing is so huge, because it's so far away, to actually dream of getting an image of it, that's incredibly hard. 
The resolution would be incredible that you need. 
SD: Black holes are the smallest objects in the known universe. 
But they have these outsize effects on whole galaxies. 
But to see one, you would need to build a telescope as large as the Earth, because the black hole that we're looking at gives off copious radio waves. 
It's emitting all the time. 
CA: And that's exactly what you did. 
SD: Exactly. What you're seeing here is we used telescopes all around the world, we synchronized them perfectly with atomic clocks, so they received the light waves from this black hole, and then we stitched all of that data together to make an image. 
CA: To do that the weather had to be right in all of those locations at the same time, so you could actually get a clear view. 
SD: We had to get lucky in a lot of different ways. 
And sometimes, it's better to be lucky than good. 
In this case, we were both, I like to think. 
But light had to come from the black hole. 
It had to come through intergalactic space, through the Earth's atmosphere, where water vapor can absorb it, and everything worked out perfectly, the size of the Earth at that wavelength of light, one millimeter wavelength, was just right to resolve that black hole, 55 million light-years away. 
The universe was telling us what to do. 
CA: So you started capturing huge amounts of data. 
I think this is like half the data from just one telescope. 
SD: Yeah, this is one of the members of our team, Lindy Blackburn, and he's sitting with half the data recorded at the Large Millimeter Telescope, which is atop a 15,000-foot mountain in Mexico. 
And what he's holding there is about half a petabyte. 
Which, to put it in terms that we might understand, it's about 5,000 people's lifetime selfie budget. 
(Laughter) CA: It's a lot of data. 
So this was all shipped, you couldn't send this over the internet. 
All this data was shipped to one place and the massive computer effort began to try and analyze it. 
And you didn't really know what you were going to see coming out of this. 
SD: The way this technique works that we used -- imagine taking an optical mirror and smashing it and putting all the shards in different places. 
The way a normal mirror works is the light rays bounce off the surface, which is perfect, and they focus in a certain point at the same time. 
We take all these recordings, and with atomic clock precision we align them perfectly, later in a supercomputer. 
And we recreate kind of an Earth-sized lens. 
And the only way to do that is to bring the data back by plane. 
You can't beat the bandwidth of a 747 filled with hard discs. 
(Laughter) CA: And so, I guess a few weeks or a few months ago, on a computer screen somewhere, this started to come into view. 
This moment. 
CA: I mean, look at this. 
That was it. 
That was the first image. 
(Applause) So tell us what we're really looking at there. 
SD: I still love it. 
(Laughter) So what you're seeing is that last orbit of photons. 
You're seeing Einstein's geometry laid bare. 
The puncture in space-time is so deep that light moves around in orbit, so that light behind the black hole, as I think we'll see soon, moves around and comes to us on these parallel lines at exactly that orbit. 
It turns out, that orbit is the square root of 27 times just a handful of fundamental constants. 
It's extraordinary when you think about it. 
CA: When ... 
In my head, initially, when I thought of black holes, I'm thinking that is the event horizon, there's lots of matter and light whirling around in that shape. 
But it's actually more complicated than that. 
Well, talk us through this animation, because it's light being lensed around it. 
SD: You'll see here that some light from behind it gets lensed, and some light does a loop-the-loop around the entire orbit of the black hole. 
But when you get enough light from all this hot gas swirling around the black hole, then you wind up seeing all of these light rays come together on this screen, which is a stand-in for where you and I are. 
And you see the definition of this ring begin to come into shape. 
And that's what Einstein predicted over 100 years ago. 
CA: Yeah, that is amazing. 
So tell us more about what we're actually looking at here. 
First of all, why is part of it brighter than the rest? 
SD: So what's happening is that the black hole is spinning. 
And you wind up with some of the gas moving towards us below and receding from us on the top. 
And just as the train whistle has a higher pitch when it's coming towards you, there's more energy from the gas coming towards us than going away from us. 
You see the bottom part brighter because the light is actually being boosted in our direction. 
CA: And how physically big is that? 
SD: Our entire solar system would fit well within that dark region. 
And if I may, that dark region is the signature of the event horizon. 
The reason we don't see light from there, is that the light that would come to us from that place was swallowed by the event horizon. 
So that -- that's it. 
CA: And so when we think of a black hole, you think of these huge rays jetting out of it, which are pointed directly in our direction. 
Why don't we see them? 
SD: This is a very powerful black hole. 
Not by universal standards, it's still powerful, and from the north and south poles of this black hole we think that jets are coming. 
Now, we're too close to really see all the jet structure, but it's the base of those jets that are illuminating the space-time. 
And that's what's being bent around the black hole. 
CA: And if you were in a spaceship whirling around that thing somehow, how long would it take to actually go around it? 
SD: First, I would give anything to be in that spaceship. 
(Laughter) Sign me up. 
There’s something called the -- if I can get wonky for one moment -- the innermost stable circular orbit, that's the innermost orbit at which matter can move around a black hole before it spirals in. 
And for this black hole, it's going to be between three days and about a month. 
CA: It's so powerful, it's weirdly slow at one level. 
I mean, you wouldn't even notice falling into that event horizon if you were there. 
SD: So you may have heard of "spaghettification," where you fall into a black hole and the gravitational field on your feet is much stronger than on your head, so you're ripped apart. 
This black hole is so big that you're not going to become a spaghetti noodle. 
You're just going to drift right through that event horizon. 
CA: So, it's like a giant tornado. 
When Dorothy was whipped by a tornado, she ended up in Oz. 
Where do you end up if you fall into a black hole? 
(Laughter) SD: Vancouver. 
(Laughter) CA: Oh, my God. 
(Applause) It's the red circle, that's terrifying. 
No, really. 
SD: Black holes really are the central mystery of our age, because that's where the quantum world and the gravitational world come together. 
What's inside is a singularity. 
And that's where all the forces become unified, because gravity finally is strong enough to compete with all the other forces. 
But it's hidden from us, the universe has cloaked it in the ultimate invisibility cloak. 
So we don't know what happens in there. 
CA: So there's a smaller one of these in our own galaxy. 
Can we go back to our own beautiful galaxy? 
This is the Milky Way, this is home. 
And somewhere in the middle of that there's another one, which you're trying to find as well. 
SD: We already know it's there, and we've already taken data on it. 
And we're working on those data right now. 
So we hope to have something in the near future, I can't say when. 
CA: It's way closer but also a lot smaller, maybe the similar kind of size to what we saw? 
SD: Right. So it turns out that the black hole in M87, that we saw before, is six and a half billion solar masses. 
But it's so far away that it appears a certain size. 
The black hole in the center of our galaxy is a thousand times less massive, but also a thousand times closer. 
So it looks the same angular size on the sky. 
CA: Finally, I guess, a nod to a remarkable group of people. 
Who are these guys? 
SD: So these are only some of the team. 
We marveled at the resonance that this image has had. 
If you told me that it would be above the fold in all of these newspapers, I'm not sure I would have believed you, but it was. 
Because this is a great mystery, and it's inspiring for us, and I hope it's inspiring to everyone. 
But the more important thing is that this is just a small number of the team. 
We're 200 people strong with 60 institutes and 20 countries and regions. 
If you want to build a global telescope you need a global team. 
And this technique that we use of linking telescopes around the world kind of effortlessly sidesteps some of the issues that divide us. 
And as scientists, we naturally come together to do something like this. 
CA: Wow, boy, that's inspiring for our whole team this week. 
Shep, thank you so much for what you did and for coming here. 
SD: Thank you. 
(Applause) 

So, I have a pretty fun job, which is to figure out what makes people happy. 
It's so fun, it might almost seen a little frivolous, especially at a time where we're being confronted with some pretty depressing headlines. 
But it turns out that studying happiness might provide a key to solving some of the toughest problems we're facing. 
It's taken me almost a decade to figure this out. 
Pretty early on in my career, I published a paper in "Science" with my collaborators, entitled, "Spending Money on Others Promotes Happiness." 
I was very confident in this conclusion, except for one thing: it didn't seem to apply to me. 
(Laughter) I hardly ever gave money to charity, and when I did, I didn't feel that warm glow I was expecting. 
So I started to wonder if maybe there was something wrong with my research or something wrong with me. 
My own lackluster emotional response to giving was especially puzzling because my follow-up studies revealed that even toddlers exhibited joy from giving to others. 
In one experiment, my colleagues Kiley Hamlin, Lara Aknin and I brought kids just under the age of two into the lab. 
Now, as you might imagine, we had to work with a resource that toddlers really care about, so we used the toddler equivalent of gold, namely, Goldfish crackers. 
(Laughter) We gave kids this windfall of Goldfish for themselves and a chance to give some of their Goldfish away to a puppet named Monkey. 
(Video) Researcher: I found even more treats, and I'm going to give them all to you. 
Toddler: Ooh. Thank you. 
Researcher: But, you know, I don't see any more treats. 
Will you give one to Monkey? 
Toddler: Yeah. Researcher: Yeah? 
Toddler: Yeah. 
Here. 
Researcher: Ooh, yummy. Mmmm. 
Toddler: All gone, he ate it. 
Elizabeth Dunn: Now, we trained research assistants to watch these videos and code toddlers' emotional reactions. 
Of course, we didn't tell them our hypotheses. 
The data revealed that toddlers were pretty happy when they got this pile of Goldfish for themselves, but they were actually even happier when they got to give some of their Goldfish away. 
And this warm glow of giving persists into adulthood. 
When we analyzed surveys from more than 200,000 adults across the globe, we saw that nearly a third of the world's population reported giving at least some money to charity in the past month. 
Remarkably, in every major region of the world, people who gave money to charity were happier than those who did not, even after taking into account their own personal financial situation. 
And this correlation wasn't trivial. 
It looked like giving to charity made about the same difference for happiness as having twice as much income. 
Now, as a researcher, if you're lucky enough to stumble on an effect that replicates around the world in children and adults alike, you start to wonder: Could this be part of human nature? 
We know that pleasure reinforces adaptive behaviors like eating and sex that help perpetuate our species, and it looked to me like giving might be one of those behaviors. 
I was really excited about these ideas, and I wrote about them in the "New York Times." 
One of the people who read this article was my accountant. 
(Laughter) Yeah. 
At tax time, I found myself seated across from him, watching as he slowly tapped his pen on the charitable giving line of my tax return with this look of, like, poorly concealed disapproval. 
(Laughter) Despite building my career by showing how great giving can feel, I actually wasn't doing very much of it. 
So I resolved to give more. 
Around that time, devastating stories about the Syrian refugee crisis were everywhere. 
I really wanted to help, so I pulled out my credit card. 
I knew my donations would probably make a difference for someone somewhere, but going to the website of an effective charity and entering my Visa number still just didn't feel like enough. 
That's when I learned about the Group of Five. 
The Canadian government allows any five Canadians to privately sponsor a family of refugees. 
You have to raise enough money to support the family for their first year in Canada, and then they literally get on a plane to your city. 
One of the things that I think is so cool about this program is that no one is allowed to do it alone. 
And instead of a Group of Five, we ended up partnering with a community organization and forming a group of 25. 
After almost two years of paperwork and waiting, we learned that our family would be arriving in Vancouver in less than six weeks. 
They had four sons and a daughter, so we raced to find them a place to live. 
We were very lucky to find them a house, but it needed quite a bit of work. 
So my friends came out on evenings and weekends and painted and cleaned and assembled furniture. 
When the big day came, we filled their fridge with milk and fresh fruit and headed to the airport to meet our family. 
It was a little overwhelming for everyone, especially the four-year-old. 
His mother was reunited with her sister who had come to Canada earlier through the same program. 
They hadn't seen each other in 15 years. 
When you hear that more than 5.6 million refugees have fled Syria, you're faced with this tragedy that the human brain hasn't really evolved to comprehend. 
It's so abstract. 
Before, if any of us had been asked to donate 15 hours a month to help out with the refugee crisis, we probably would have said no. 
But as soon as we took our family to their new home in Vancouver, we all had the same realization: we were just going to do whatever it took to help them be happy. 
This experience made me think a little more deeply about my research. 
Back in my lab, we'd seen the benefits of giving spike when people felt a real sense of connection with those they were helping and could easily envision the difference they were making in those individuals' lives. 
For example, in one experiment, we gave participants an opportunity to donate a bit of money to either UNICEF or Spread the Net. 
We chose these charities intentionally, because they were partners and shared the same critically important goal of promoting children's health. 
But I think UNICEF is just such a big, broad charity that it can be a little hard to envision how your own small donation will make a difference. 
In contrast, Spread the Net offers donors a concrete promise: for every 10 dollars donated, they provide one bed net to protect a child from malaria. 
We saw that the more money people gave to Spread the Net, the happier they reported feeling afterward. 
In contrast, this emotional return on investment was completely eliminated when people gave money to UNICEF. 
So this suggests that just giving money to a worthwhile charity isn't always enough. 
You need to be able to envision how, exactly, your dollars are going to make a difference. 
Of course, the Group of Five program takes this idea to a whole new level. 
When we first took on this project, we would talk about when the refugees would arrive. 
Now, we just refer to them as our family. 
Recently, we took the kids ice skating, and later that day, my six-year-old, Oliver, asked me, "Mommy, who is the oldest kid in our family?" 
I assumed he was talking about his plethora of cousins, and he was talking about them, but also about our Syrian family. 
Since our family arrived, so many people and organizations have offered to help, providing everything from free dental fillings to summer camps. 
It's made me see the goodness that exists in our community. 
Thanks to one donation, the kids got to go to bike camp, and every day of the week, some member of our group tried to be there to cheer for them. 
I happened to be there the day the training wheels were supposed to come off, and let me tell you, the four-year-old did not think this was a good idea. 
So I went over and talked to him about the long-term benefits of riding without training wheels. 
(Laughter) Then I remembered that he was four and barely spoke English. 
So I reverted to two words he definitely knew: ice cream. 
You try without training wheels, I'll buy you ice cream. 
Here's what happened next. 
(Video) ED: Yes. Yeah! 
Kid: I'm gonna try. 
ED: Oh my God! Look at you go! 
(Squealing) Look at you go! You're doing it all by yourself! 
(Audience) (Laughter) (Video) ED: Good job! 
(Audience) (Laughter) (Applause) ED: So this is the kind of helping that human beings evolved to enjoy, but for 40 years, Canada was the only country in the world that allowed private citizens to sponsor refugees. 
Now -- Canada! 
(Applause) It's pretty great. 
Now Australia and the UK are starting up similar programs. 
Just imagine how different the refugee crisis could look if more countries made this possible. 
Creating these kinds of meaningful connections between individuals provides an opportunity to deal with challenges that feel overwhelming. 
One of those challenges lies just blocks from where I'm standing right now, in the Downtown Eastside of Vancouver. 
By some measures, it's the poorest urban postal code in Canada. 
We actually debated whether to bring over a family of refugees, because there are so many people right here already struggling. 
My friend Evan told me that when he was a kid and his parents drove through this neighborhood, he would duck down in the back seat. 
But Evan's parents never would have guessed that when he grew up, he would open up the doors of a local restaurant and invite this community inside to enjoy three-course dinners. 
The program that Evan helped build is called "Plenty of Plates," and the goal is not just to provide free meals but to create moments of connection between people who otherwise might never make eye contact. 
Each night, a local business sponsors the dinner and sends a team of volunteers who help make and serve the meal. 
Afterward, the leftovers get distributed to people who are out on the street, and importantly, there's enough money left to provide a thousand free lunches for this community in the days that follow. 
But the benefits of this program extend beyond food. 
For the volunteers, it provides an opportunity to engage with people, to sit down and hear their stories. 
After this experience, one volunteer changed his commute so that instead of avoiding this neighborhood, he walks through it, smiling or making eye contact as he passes familiar faces. 
All of us are capable of finding joy in giving. 
But we shouldn't expect this to happen automatically. 
Spending money helping others doesn't necessarily promote happiness. 
Instead, it matters how we do it. 
And if we want people to give more, we need to subvert the way we think about charitable giving. 
We need to create opportunities to give that enable us to appreciate our shared humanity. 
If any of you work for a charity, don't reward your donors with pens or calendars. 
(Applause) Reward them with the opportunity to see the specific impact that their generosity is having and to connect with the individuals and communities they're helping. 
We're used to thinking about giving as something we should do. 
And it is. 
But in thinking about it this way, we're missing out on one of the best parts of being human: that we have evolved to find joy in helping others. 
Let's stop thinking about giving as just this moral obligation and start thinking of it as a source of pleasure. 
Thank you. 
(Applause) 

These are sequences from a play called "The Lehman Trilogy," which traces the origins of Western capitalism in three hours, with three actors and a piano. 
And my role was to create a stage design to write a visual language for this work. 
The play describes Atlantic crossings, Alabama cotton fields, New York skylines, and we framed the whole thing within this single revolving cube, a kind of kinetic cinema through the centuries. 
It's like a musical instrument played by three performers. 
And as they step their way around and through the lives of the Lehman brothers, we, the audience, begin to connect with the simple, human origins at the root of the complex global financial systems that we're all still in thrall to today. 
I used to play musical instruments myself when I was younger. 
My favorite was the violin. 
It was this intimate transfer of energy. 
You held this organic sculpture up to your heart, and you poured the energy of your whole body into this little piece of wood, and heard it translated into music. 
And I was never particularly good at the violin, but I used to sit at the back of the second violin section in the Hastings Youth Orchestra, scratching away. 
We were all scratching and marveling at this symphonic sound that we were making that was so much more beautiful and powerful than anything we would ever have managed on our own. 
And now, as I create large-scale performances, I am always working with teams that are at least the size of a symphony orchestra. 
And whether we are creating these revolving giant chess piece time tunnels for an opera by Richard Wagner or shark tanks and mountains for Kanye West, we're always seeking to create the most articulate sculpture, the most poetic instrument of communication to an audience. 
When I say poetic, I just mean language at its most condensed, like a song lyric, a poetic puzzle to be unlocked and unpacked. 
And when we were preparing to design Beyoncé's "Formation" tour, we looked at all the lyrics, and we came across this poem that Beyoncé wrote. 
"I saw a TV preacher when I was scared, at four or five about bad dreams who promised he'd say a prayer if I put my hand to the TV. 
That's the first time I remember prayer, an electric current running through me." 
And this TV that transmitted prayer to Beyoncé as a child became this monolithic revolving sculpture that broadcast Beyoncé to the back of the stadium. 
And the stadium is a mass congregation. 
It's a temporary population of a hundred thousand people who have all come there to sing along with every word together, but they've also come there each seeking one-to-one intimacy with the performer. 
And we, as we conceive the show, we have to provide intimacy on a grand scale. 
It usually starts with sketches. 
I was drawing this 60-foot-high, revolving, broadcast-quality portrait of the artist, and then I tore the piece of paper in half. 
I split the mask to try to access the human underneath it all. 
And it's one thing to do sketches, but of course translating from a sketch into a tourable revolving six-story building took some exceptional engineers working around the clock for three months, until finally we arrived in Miami and opened the show in April 2016. 
(Video: Cheers) (Music: "Formation," Beyoncé) Beyoncé: Y'all haters corny with that Illuminati mess Paparazzi, catch my fly, and my cocky fresh I'm so reckless when I rock my Givenchy dress I'm so possessive so I rock his Roc necklaces My daddy Alabama Momma Louisiana You mix that negro with that Creole make a Texas bama (Music ends) I call my work -- (Cheers, applause) Thank you. 
(Cheers, applause) I call my work stage sculpture, but of course what's really being sculpted is the experience of the audience, and as directors and designers, we have to take responsibility for every minute that the audience spend with us. 
We're a bit like pilots navigating a flight path for a hundred thousand passengers. 
And in the case of the Canadian artist The Weeknd, we translated this flight path literally into an origami paper folding airplane that took off over the heads of the audience, broke apart in mid-flight, complications, and then rose out of the ashes restored at the end of the show. 
And like any flight, the most delicate part is the liftoff, the beginning, because when you design a pop concert, the prime material that you're working with is something that doesn't take trucks or crew to transport it. 
It doesn't cost anything, and yet it fills every atom of air in the arena, before the show starts. 
It's the audience's anticipation. 
Everyone brings with them the story of how they came to get there, the distances they traveled, the months they had to work to pay for the tickets. 
Sometimes they sleep overnight outside the arena, and our first task is to deliver for an audience on their anticipation, to deliver their first sight of the performer. 
When I work with men, they're quite happy to have their music transformed into metaphor -- spaceflights, mountains. 
But with women, we work a lot with masks and with three-dimensional portraiture, because the fans of the female artist crave her face. 
And when the audience arrived to see Adele's first live concert in five years, they were met with this image of her eyes asleep. 
If they listened carefully, they would hear her sleeping breath echoing around the arena, waiting to wake up. 
Here's how the show began. 
(Video: Cheers, applause) (Music) Adele: Hello. 
(Cheers, applause) Es Devlin: With U2, we're navigating the audience over a terrain that spans three decades of politics, poetry and music. 
And over many months, meeting with the band and their creative teams, this is the sketch that kept recurring, this line, this street, the street that connects the band's past with their present, the tightrope that they walk as activists and artists, a walk through cinema that allows the band to become protagonists in their own poetry. 
(Music: U2's "Where the Streets Have No Name") Bono: I wanna run I want to hide I wanna tear down the walls That hold me inside Es Devlin: The end of the show is like the end of a flight. 
It's an arrival. 
It's a transfer from the stage out to the audience. 
For the British band Take That, we ended the show by sending an 80-foot high mechanical human figure out to the center of the crowd. 
(Music) Like many translations from music to mechanics, this one was initially deemed entirely technically impossible. 
The first three engineers we took it to said no, and eventually, the way that it was achieved was by keeping the entire control system together while it toured around the country, so we had to fold it up onto a flatbed truck so it could tour around without coming apart. 
And of course, what this meant was that the dimension of its head was entirely determined by the lowest motorway bridge that it had to travel under on its tour. 
And I have to tell you that it turns out there is an unavoidable and annoyingly low bridge low bridge just outside Hamburg. 
(Laughter) (Music) Another of the most technically complex pieces that we've worked on is the opera "Carmen" at Bregenz Festival in Austria. 
We envisaged Carmen's hands rising out of Lake Constance, and throwing this deck of cards in the air and leaving them suspended between sky and sea. 
But this transient gesture, this flick of the wrists had to become a structure that would be strong enough to withstand two Austrian winters. 
So there's an awful lot that you don't see in this photograph that's working really hard. 
It's a lot of ballast and structure and support around the back, and I'm going to show you the photos that aren't on my website. 
They're photos of the back of a set, the part that's not designed for the audience to see, however much work it's doing. 
And you know, this is actually the dilemma for an artist who is working as a stage designer, because so much of what I make is fake, it's an illusion. 
And yet every artist works in pursuit of communicating something that's true. 
But we are always asking ourselves: "Can we communicate truth using things that are false?" 
And now when I attend the shows that I've worked on, I often find I'm the only one who is not looking at the stage. 
I'm looking at something that I find equally fascinating, and it's the audience. 
(Cheers) I mean, where else do you witness this: (Cheers) this many humans, connected, focused, undistracted and unfragmented? 
And lately, I've begun to make work that originates here, in the collective voice of the audience. 
"Poem Portraits" is a collective poem. 
It began at the Serpentine Gallery in London, and everybody is invited to donate one word to a collective poem. 
And instead of that large single LED portrait that was broadcasting to the back of the stadium, in this case, every member of the audience gets to take their own portrait home with them, and it's woven in with the words that they've contributed to the collective poem. 
So they keep a fragment of an ever-evolving collective work. 
And next year, the collective poem will take architectural form. 
This is the design for the UK Pavilion at the World Expo 2020. 
The UK ... 
In my lifetime, it's never felt this divided. 
It's never felt this noisy with divergent voices. 
And it's never felt this much in need of places where voices might connect and converge. 
And it's my hope that this wooden sculpture, this wooden instrument, a bit like that violin I used to play, might be a place where people can play and enter their word at one end of the cone, emerge at the other end of the building, and find that their word has joined a collective poem, a collective voice. 
(Music) These are simple experiments in machine learning. 
The algorithm that generates the collective poem is pretty simple. 
It's like predictive text, only it's trained on millions of words written by poets in the 19th century. 
So it's a sort of convergence of intelligence, past and present, organic and inorganic. 
And we were inspired by the words of Stephen Hawking. 
Towards the end of his life, he asked quite a simple question: If we as a species were ever to come across another advanced life-form, an advanced civilization, how would we speak to them? 
What collective language would we speak as a planet? 
The language of light reaches every audience. 
All of us are touched by it. None of us can hold it. 
And in the theater, we begin each work in a dark place, devoid of light. 
We stay up all night focusing the lights, programming the lights, trying to find new ways to sculpt and carve light. 
(Music) This is a portrait of our practice, always seeking new ways to shape and reshape light, always finding words for things that we no longer need to say. 
And I want to say that this, and everything that I've just shown you, no longer exists in physical form. 
(Music) In fact, most of what I've made over the last 25 years doesn't exist anymore. 
But our work endures in memories, in synaptic sculptures, in the minds of those who were once present in the audience. 
(Music) I once read that a poem learnt by heart is what you have left, what can't be lost, even if your house burns down and you've lost all your possessions. 
I want to end with some lines that I learnt by heart a long time ago. 
(Music) They're written by the English novelist E.M. Forster, in 1910, just a few years before Europe, my continent, (Music) began tearing itself apart. 
(Music) And his call to convergence still resonates through most of what we're trying to make now. 
(Music) "Only connect! That was the whole of her sermon. 
Only connect the prose and the passion, and both will be exalted, And human love will be seen at its height. 
Only connect! And live in fragments no longer." 
Thank you. 
(Applause) 

On the red tiles in my family's den I would dance and sing to the made-for-TV movie "Gypsy," starring Bette Midler. 
(Singing) "I had a dream. 
A wonderful dream, papa." 
I would sing it with the urgency and the burning desire of a nine-year-old who did, in fact, have a dream. 
My dream was to be an actress. 
And it's true that I never saw anyone who looked like me in television or in films, and sure, my family and friends and teachers all constantly warned me that people like me didn't make it in Hollywood. 
But I was an American. 
I had been taught to believe that anyone could achieve anything, regardless of the color of their skin, the fact that my parents immigrated from Honduras, the fact that I had no money. 
I didn't need my dream to be easy, I just needed it to be possible. 
And when I was 15, I got my first professional audition. 
It was a commercial for cable subscriptions or bail bonds, I don't really remember. 
(Laughter) What I do remember is that the casting director asked me, "Could you do that again, but just this time, sound more Latina." 
"Um, OK. 
So you want me to do it in Spanish?" I asked. 
"No, no, do it in English, just sound Latina." 
"Well, I am a Latina, so isn't this what a Latina sounds like?" 
There was a long and awkward silence, and then finally, "OK, sweetie, never mind, thank you for coming in, bye!" 
It took me most of the car ride home to realize that by "sound more Latina" she was asking me to speak in broken English. 
And I couldn't figure out why the fact that I was an actual, real-life, authentic Latina didn't really seem to matter. 
Anyway, I didn't get the job. 
I didn't get a lot of the jobs people were willing to see me for: the gang-banger's girlfriend, the sassy shoplifter, pregnant chola number two. 
(Laughter) These were the kinds of roles that existed for someone like me. 
Someone they looked at and saw as too brown, too fat, too poor, too unsophisticated. 
These roles were stereotypes and couldn't have been further from my own reality or from the roles I dreamt of playing. 
I wanted to play people who were complex and multidimensional, people who existed in the center of their own lives. 
Not cardboard cutouts that stood in the background of someone else's. 
But when I dared to say that to my manager -- that's the person I pay to help me find opportunity -- his response was, "Someone has to tell that girl she has unrealistic expectations." 
And he wasn't wrong. 
I mean, I fired him, but he wasn't wrong. 
(Laughter) (Applause) Because whenever I did try to get a role that wasn't a poorly written stereotype, I would hear, "We're not looking to cast this role diversely." 
Or, "We love her, but she's too specifically ethnic." 
Or, "Unfortunately, we already have one Latino in this movie." 
I kept receiving the same message again and again and again. 
That my identity was an obstacle I had to overcome. 
And so I thought, "Come at me, obstacle. 
I'm an American. My name is America. 
I trained my whole life for this, I'll just follow the playbook, I'll work harder." 
And so I did, I worked my hardest to overcome all the things that people said were wrong with me. 
I stayed out of the sun so that my skin wouldn't get too brown, I straightened my curls into submission. 
I constantly tried to lose weight, I bought fancier and more expensive clothes. 
All so that when people looked at me, they wouldn't see a too fat, too brown, too poor Latina. 
They would see what I was capable of. 
And maybe they would give me a chance. 
And in an ironic twist of fate, when I finally did get a role that would make all my dreams come true, it was a role that required me to be exactly who I was. 
Ana in "Real Women Have Curves" was a brown, poor, fat Latina. 
I had never seen anyone like her, anyone like me, existing in the center of her own life story. 
I traveled throughout the US and to multiple countries with this film where people, regardless of their age, ethnicity, body type, saw themselves in Ana. 
A 17-year-old chubby Mexican American girl struggling against cultural norms to fulfill her unlikely dream. 
In spite of what I had been told my whole life, I saw firsthand that people actually did want to see stories about people like me. 
And that my unrealistic expectations to see myself authentically represented in the culture were other people’s expectations, too. 
"Real Women Have Curves" was a critical, cultural and financial success. 
"Great," I thought, "We did it! 
We proved our stories have value. 
Things are going to change now." 
But I watched as very little happened. 
There was no watershed. 
No one in the industry was rushing to tell more stories about the audience that was hungry and willing to pay to see them. 
Four years later, when I got to play Ugly Betty, I saw the same phenomenon play out. 
"Ugly Betty" premiered in the US to 16 million viewers and was nominated for 11 Emmys in its first year. 
(Applause) But in spite of "Ugly Betty's" success, there would not be another television show led by a Latina actress on American television for eight years. 
It's been 12 years since I became the first and only Latina to ever win an Emmy in a lead category. 
That is not a point of pride. 
That is a point of deep frustration. 
Not because awards prove our worth, but because who we see thriving in the world teaches us how to see ourselves, how to think about our own value, how to dream about our futures. 
And anytime I begin to doubt that, I remember that there was a little girl, living in the Swat Valley of Pakistan. 
And somehow, she got her hands on some DVDs of an American television show in which she saw her own dream of becoming a writer reflected. 
In her autobiography, Malala wrote, "I had become interested in journalism after seeing how my own words could make a difference and also from watching the "Ugly Betty" DVDs about life at an American magazine." 
(Applause) For 17 years of my career, I have witnessed the power our voices have when they can access presence in the culture. 
I've seen it. 
I've lived it, we've all seen it. 
In entertainment, in politics, in business, in social change. 
We cannot deny it -- presence creates possibility. 
But for the last 17 years, I've also heard the same excuses for why some of us can access presence in the culture and some of us can't. 
Our stories don't have an audience, our experiences won't resonate in the mainstream, our voices are too big a financial risk. 
Just a few years ago, my agent called to explain to me why I wasn't getting a role in a movie. 
He said, "They loved you and they really, really do want to cast diversely, but the movie isn't financeable until they cast the white role first." 
He delivered the message with a broken heart and with a tone that communicated, "I understand how messed up this is." 
But nonetheless, just like hundreds of times before, I felt the tears roll down my face. 
And the pang of rejection rise up in me and then the voice of shame scolding me, "You are a grown woman, stop crying over a job." 
I went through this process for years of accepting the failure as my own and then feeling deep shame that I couldn't overcome the obstacles. 
But this time, I heard a new voice. 
A voice that said, "I'm tired. 
I've had enough." 
A voice that understood my tears and my pain were not about losing a job. 
They were about what was actually being said about me. 
What had been said about me my whole life by executives and producers and directors and writers and agents and managers and teachers and friends and family. 
That I was a person of less value. 
I thought sunscreen and straightening irons would bring about change in this deeply entrenched value system. 
But what I realized in that moment was that I was never actually asking the system to change. 
I was asking it to let me in, and those aren't the same thing. 
I couldn't change what a system believed about me, while I believed what the system believed about me. 
And I did. 
I, like everyone around me, believed that it wasn't possible for me to exist in my dream as I was. 
And I went about trying to make myself invisible. 
What this revealed to me was that it is possible to be the person who genuinely wants to see change while also being the person whose actions keep things the way they are. 
And what it's led me to believe is that change isn't going to come by identifying the good guys and the bad guys. 
That conversation lets us all off the hook. 
Because most of us are neither one of those. 
Change will come when each of us has the courage to question our own fundamental values and beliefs. 
And then see to it that our actions lead to our best intentions. 
I am just one of millions of people who have been told that in order to fulfill my dreams, in order to contribute my talents to the world I have to resist the truth of who I am. 
I for one, am ready to stop resisting and to start existing as my full and authentic self. 
If I could go back and say anything to that nine-year-old, dancing in the den, dreaming her dreams, I would say, my identity is not my obstacle. 
My identity is my superpower. 
Because the truth is, I am what the world looks like. 
You are what the world looks like. 
Collectively, we are what the world actually looks like. 
And in order for our systems to reflect that, they don't have to create a new reality. 
They just have to stop resisting the one we already live in. 
Thank you. 
(Applause) 

This is a strange and wonderful brain, one that gives rise to an idea of a kind of alternative intelligence on this planet. 
This is a brain that is formed in a very strange body, one that has the equivalent of small satellite brains distributed throughout that body. 
How different is it from the human brain? 
Very different, so it seems, so much so that my colleagues and I are struggling to understand how that brain works. 
But what I can tell you for certain is that this brain is capable of some amazing things. 
So, who does this brain belong to? 
Well, join me for a little bit of diving into the ocean, where life began, and let's have a look. 
You may have seen some of this before, but we're behind a coral reef, and there's this rock out there, a lot of sand, fishes swimming around ... 
And all of a sudden this octopus appears, and now it flashes white, inks in my face and jets away. 
In slow motion reverse, you see the ring develop around the eye, and then the pattern develops in the skin. 
And now watch the 3-D texture of the skin change to really create this beautiful, 3-D camouflage. 
So there are 25 million color organs called "chromatophores" in the skin, and all those bumps out there, which we call "papillae," and they're all neurally controlled and can change instantaneously. 
I would argue that dynamic camouflage is a form of "intelligence." 
The level of complexity of the skin with fast precision change is really quite astonishing. 
So what can you do with this skin? 
Well, let's think a little bit about other things besides camouflage that they can do with their skin. 
Here you see the mimic octopus and a pattern. 
All of a sudden, it changes dramatically -- that's signaling, not camouflage. 
And then it goes back to the normal pattern. 
Then you see the broadclub cuttlefish showing this passing cloud display as it approaches a crab prey. 
And finally, you see the flamboyant cuttlefish in camouflage and it can shift instantly to this bright warning display. 
What we have here is a sliding scale of expression, a continuum, if you will, between conspicuousness and camouflage. 
And this requires a lot of control. 
Well, guess what? 
Brains are really good for control. 
The brain of the octopus shown here has 35 lobes to the brain, 80 million tiny cells. 
And even though that's interesting, what's really odd is that the skin of this animal has many more neurons, as illustrated here, especially in the yellow. 
There are 300 million neurons in the skin and only 80 million in the brain itself -- four times as many. 
Now, if you look at that, there's actually one of those little satellite brains and the equivalent of the spinal cord for each of the eight arms. 
This is a very unusual way to construct a nervous system in a body. 
Well, what is that brain good for? 
That brain has to outwit other big, smart brains that are trying to eat it, and that includes porpoises and seals and barracudas and sharks and even us humans. 
So decision-making is one of the things that this brain has to do, and it does a very good job of it. 
Shown here, you see this octopus perambulating along, and then it suddenly stops and creates that perfect camouflage. 
And it's really marvelous, because when these animals forage in the wild, they have to make over a hundred camouflaging decisions in a two-hour forage, and they do that twice a day. 
So, decision-making. 
They're also figuring out where to go and how to get back home. 
So it's a decision-making thing. 
We can test this camouflage, like that cuttlefish you see behind me, where we pull the rug out from under it and give it a checkerboard, and it even uses that strange visual information and does its best to match the pattern with a little ad-libbing. 
So other cognitive skills are important, too. 
The squids have a different kind of smarts, if you will. 
They have an extremely complex, interesting sex life. 
They have fighting and flirting and courting and mate-guarding and deception. 
Sound familiar? 
(Laughter) And it's really quite amazing that these animals have this kind of intuitive ability to do these behaviors. 
Here you see a male and a female. 
The male, on the left, has been fighting off other males to pair with the female, and now he's showing a dual pattern. 
He shows courtship and love on her side, fighting on the other. 
Watch him when she shifts places -- (Laughter) and you see that he has fluidly changed the love-courtship pattern to the side of the female. 
So this kind of dual signaling simultaneously with a changing behavioral context is really extraordinary. 
It takes a lot of brain power. 
Now, another way to look at this is that, hmm, maybe we have 50 million years of evidence for the two-faced male. 
(Laughter) All right, let's move on. 
(Laughter) An octopus on a coral reef has a tough job in front it to go to so many places, remember and find its den. 
And they do this extremely well. 
They have short- and long-term memory, they learn things in three to five trials -- it's a good brain. 
And the spatial memory is unusually good. 
They will even end their forage and make a beeline all the way back to their den. 
The divers watching them are completely lost, but they can get back, so it's really quite refined memory capability. 
Now, in terms of cognitive skills, look at this sleeping behavior in the cuttlefish. 
Especially on the right, you see the eye twitching. 
This is rapid eye movement kind of dreaming that we only thought mammals and birds did. 
And you see the false color we put in there to see the skin patterning flashing, and this is what's happening a lot. 
But it's not normal awake behaviors; it's all different. 
Well, dreaming is when you have memory consolidation, and so this is probably what's happening in the cuttlefish. 
Now, another form of memory that's really unusual is episodic-like memory. 
This is something that humans need four years of brain development to do to remember what happened during a particular event, where it happened and when it happened. 
The "when" part is particularly difficult, and these children can do that. 
But guess what? 
We find recently that the wily cuttlefish also has this ability, and in experiments last summer, when you present a cuttlefish with different foods at different times, they have to match that with where it was exactly and when was the last time they saw it. 
Then they have to guide their foraging to the rate of replenishment of each food type in a different place. 
Sound complicated? 
It's so complicated, I hardly understood the experiment. 
So this is really high-level cognitive processing. 
Now, speaking of brains and evolution at the moment, you look on the right, there's the pathway of vertebrate brain evolution, and we all have good brains. 
I think everyone will acknowledge that. 
But if you look on the left side, some of the evolutionary pathway outlined here to the octopus, they have both converged, if you will, to complex behaviors and some form of intelligence. 
The last common denominator in these two lines was 600 million years ago, and it was a worm with very few neurons, so very divergent paths but convergence of complicated behavior. 
Here is the fundamental question: Is the brain structure of an octopus basically different down to the tiniest level from the vertebrate line? 
Now, we don't know the answer, but if it turns out to be yes, then we have a different evolutionary pathway to create intelligence on planet Earth, and one might think that the artificial intelligence community might be interested in those mechanisms. 
Well, let's talk genetics just for a moment. 
We have genomes, we have DNA, DNA is transcripted into RNA, RNA translates that into a protein, and that's how we come to be. 
Well, the cephalopods do it differently. 
They have big genomes, they have DNA, they transcript it into RNA, but now something dramatically different happens. 
They edit that RNA at an astronomical weird rate, a hundredfold more than we as humans or other animals do. 
And it produces scores of proteins. 
And guess where most of them are for? 
The nervous system. 
So perhaps this is an unorthodox way for an animal to evolve behavioral plasticity. 
This is a lot of conjecture, but it's food for thought. 
Now, I'd like to share with you for a moment my experience, and using my smarts and that of my colleagues, to try and get this kind of information. 
We're diving, we can't stay underwater forever because we can't breathe it, so we have to be efficient in what we do. 
The total sensory immersion into that world is what helps us understand what these animals are really doing, and I have to tell you that it's really an amazing experience to be down there and having this communication with an octopus and a diver when you really begin to understand that this is a thinking, cogitating, curious animal. 
And this is the kind of thing that really inspires me endlessly. 
Let's go back to that smart skin for a few moments. 
Here's a squid and a camouflage pattern. 
We zoom down and we see there's beautiful pigments and reflectors. 
There are the chromatophores opening and closing very quickly. 
And then, in the next layer of skin, it's quite interesting. 
The chromatophores are closed, and you see this magical iridescence just come out of the skin. 
This is also neurally controlled, so it's the combination of the two, as seen here in the high-resolution skin of the cuttlefish, where you get this beautiful pigmentary structural coloration and even the faint blushing that is so beautiful. 
Well, how can we make use of some of this information? 
I talked about those skin bumps, the papillae. 
Here's the giant Australian cuttlefish. 
It's got smooth skin and a conspicuous pattern. 
I took five pictures in a row one second apart, and just watch this animal morph -- one, two, three, four, five -- and now I'm a seaweed. 
And then we can come right back out of it to see the smooth skin and the conspicuousness. 
So this is really marvelous, morphing skin. 
You can see it in more detail here. 
Periscope up, and you've got those beautiful papillae. 
And then we look in a little more detail, you can see the individual papillae come up, and there are little ridges on there, so it's a papilla on papilla and so forth. 
Every individual species out there has more than a dozen shapes and sizes of those bumps to create fine-tuned, neurally controlled camouflage. 
So now, my colleagues at Cornell, engineers, watched our work and said, "We think we can make some of those." 
Because in industry and society, this kind of soft materials under control of shape are really very rare. 
And they went ahead, worked with us and made the first samples of artificial papillae, soft materials, shown here. 
And you see them blown up into different shapes, And then you can press your finger on them to see that they're a little bit malleable as they are. 
And so this is an example of how that might work. 
Well, I want to segue from this into the color of fabrics, and I imagine that could have a lot of applications as well. 
Just look at this kaleidoscope of color of dynamically controlled pigments and reflectors that we see in the cephalopods. 
We know enough about the mechanics of how they work that we can begin to translate this not only into fabrics but perhaps even into changeable cosmetics. 
And moreover, there's been the recent discovery of light-sensing molecules in the skin of octopus which may pave the way to, eventually, smart materials that sense and respond on their own. 
Well, this form of biotechnology, or biomimicry, if you will, could change the way we look at the world even above water. 
Take, for example, artificial intelligence that might be inspired by the body-distributed brain and behavior of the octopus or the smart skin of a cuttlefish translated into cutting-edge fashion. 
Well, how do we get there? 
Maybe all we have to do is to begin to be a little bit smarter about how smart the cephalopods are. 
Thank you. 
(Applause) 

Ah, earth's oceans. 
They are beautiful, inspiring, life-sustaining. 
They are also, as you're probably quite aware, more or less screwed. 
In the Seychelles, for example, human activities and climate change have left corals bleached. 
Overfishing has caused fish stocks to plummet. 
Biodiversity is in peril. 
So what can we do? 
Well, some form of protection, obviously. 
Nature is very resilient. 
When marine areas are strategically protected, entire ecosystems can bounce back. 
However, creating marine protected areas isn't easy. 
First, you have the issue of figuring out where to protect. 
This coral reef overlaps with that international fishing route, intersects with this fish hatchery. 
Everything is interconnected. 
And marine protection plans must take into account how one area affects another. 
Then, there's the issue of getting everyone on board. 
Coastal economies often rely on fishing and tourism. 
If people think they can't do their work, there's no chance of getting the local buy-in you need for the area to be successful. 
Marine protected areas must also be enforced. 
That means the government itself must be deeply invested in the plan. 
Token support will not cut it. 
And finally, conservation requires money. 
A lot of it. 
Governments in island and coastal nations may want to protect their waters, but often these nations have very high debt and can't afford to prioritize conservation. 
If we rely on philanthropic dollars alone to fund marine protection, we might get a small marine-protected area here, another little one there. 
But we need more marine protected areas faster, to have lasting impact. 
So what exactly does smart ocean conservation look like? 
How do we get the money, government support and careful planning that takes into account both local economies and complex ecosystems? 
We want to share with you an audacious idea from The Nature Conservancy. 
It seeks to address all of these things in one fell swoop. 
They've realized that debt held by island and coastal nations is the very thing that will enable them to achieve their conservation goals. 
TNC's idea is to restructure this debt, to generate the funds and political will to protect reefs, mangroves and fisheries. 
For example, if you refinance your house to take advantage of a better interest rate, maybe you use the savings to insulate your attic. 
That's what Blue Bonds for Conservation do for entire coastal countries. 
Refinance the debt, then use the savings to create marine protected areas. 
Of course, sovereign debt restructuring is more complicated than that, but you get the basic idea. 
If investors put in 40 million dollars now, it can unlock as much as 1.6 billion for ocean conservation. 
And this is how the work gets done. 
Step one: negotiate the deal. 
A coastal nation commits to protect at least 30 percent of its ocean areas. 
In exchange, The Nature Conservancy bring investors, public funders and international development organizations to the table to restructure a portion of the nation's debt, leading to lower interest rates and longer repayment periods. 
Step two: create a marine plan. 
Simultaneously, The Nature Conservancy works with marine scientists, government leaders and local stakeholders to create a detailed conservation plan that integrates the needs of the ocean with the needs of the people. 
Step three: activate for longevity. 
TNC establishes an independently run conservation trust fund. 
The savings from the debt restructure goes into it to support new marine protected areas. 
The trust then holds the government accountable for its commitments, ensuring that the Blue Bonds finance real protection efforts. 
Could this plan work? 
It already has. 
In 2016, TNC helped create a national conservation plan in the Seychelles. 
TNC restructured 22 million dollars of the government's debt. 
And in exchange, the government agreed to protect 30 percent of its marine areas. 
Today, the Seychelles is on track to protect 400,000 square kilometers of ocean. 
That's an area roughly the size of Germany. 
The Seychelles is protecting its coral reefs, it's replenishing its fisheries, it's improving its resilience to climate change. 
At the same time, it's strengthening its economy. 
This success is making other governments take note. 
Many want to be part of this. 
There's an opportunity to scale this up, dramatically. 
And fast. 
TNC has identified 20 more nations where such a plan should be possible. 
But to execute, they need seed capital. 
And to put in place local teams who can develop conservation plans, work with all the stakeholders and structure the deals. 
If they get the support they need over the next five years, they could protect four million square kilometers of ocean. 
That's 10 Germanies. 
This would increase the amount of protected areas in all of the world's oceans by an incredible 15 percent. 
It would allow vast tracks of the world's coral reefs to replenish and give safe harbor to countless species. 
This would be truly incredible. 
And it's really just the beginning. 
Because there aren't 20 countries in the world where this kind of debt conversion would work. 
There are almost 100. 
With this approach, everyone wins. 
Governments, local citizens, funders, and most importantly, our oceans. 
So in fact, we all win. 
Ah, earth's oceans.

"The Road Not Taken" By Robert Frost Two roads diverged in a yellow wood, And sorry I could not travel both And be one traveler, long I stood and looked down one as far as I could To where it bent in the undergrowth; Then took the other, as just as fair, And having perhaps the better claim, Because it was grassy and wanted wear; Though as for that the passing there Had worn them really about the same, And both that morning equally lay In leaves no step had trodden black. 
Oh, I kept the first for another day! Yet knowing how way leads on to way, I doubted if I should ever come back. 
I shall be telling this with a sigh Somewhere ages and ages hence: Two roads diverged in a wood, and I— I took the one less traveled by, And that has made all the difference. 

I want to talk today about how reading can change our lives and about the limits of that change. 
I want to talk to you about how reading can give us a shareable world of powerful human connection. 
But also about how that connection is always partial. 
How reading is ultimately a lonely, idiosyncratic undertaking. 
The writer who changed my life was the great African American novelist James Baldwin. 
When I was growing up in Western Michigan in the 1980s, there weren't many Asian American writers interested in social change. 
And so I think I turned to James Baldwin as a way to fill this void, as a way to feel racially conscious. 
But perhaps because I knew I wasn't myself African American, I also felt challenged and indicted by his words. 
Especially these words: "There are liberals who have all the proper attitudes, but no real convictions. 
When the chips are down and you somehow expect them to deliver, they are somehow not there." 
They are somehow not there. 
I took those words very literally. 
Where should I put myself? 
I went to the Mississippi Delta, one of the poorest regions in the United States. 
This is a place shaped by a powerful history. 
In the 1960s, African Americans risked their lives to fight for education, to fight for the right to vote. 
I wanted to be a part of that change, to help young teenagers graduate and go to college. 
When I got to the Mississippi Delta, it was a place that was still poor, still segregated, still dramatically in need of change. 
My school, where I was placed, had no library, no guidance counselor, but it did have a police officer. 
Half the teachers were substitutes and when students got into fights, the school would send them to the local county jail. 
This is the school where I met Patrick. 
He was 15 and held back twice, he was in the eighth grade. 
He was quiet, introspective, like he was always in deep thought. 
And he hated seeing other people fight. 
I saw him once jump between two girls when they got into a fight and he got himself knocked to the ground. 
Patrick had just one problem. 
He wouldn't come to school. 
He said that sometimes school was just too depressing because people were always fighting and teachers were quitting. 
And also, his mother worked two jobs and was just too tired to make him come. 
So I made it my job to get him to come to school. 
And because I was crazy and 22 and zealously optimistic, my strategy was just to show up at his house and say, "Hey, why don't you come to school?" 
And this strategy actually worked, he started to come to school every day. 
And he started to flourish in my class. 
He was writing poetry, he was reading books. 
He was coming to school every day. 
Around the same time that I had figured out how to connect to Patrick, I got into law school at Harvard. 
I once again faced this question, where should I put myself, where do I put my body? 
And I thought to myself that the Mississippi Delta was a place where people with money, people with opportunity, those people leave. 
And the people who stay behind are the people who don't have the chance to leave. 
I didn't want to be a person who left. 
I wanted to be a person who stayed. 
On the other hand, I was lonely and tired. 
And so I convinced myself that I could do more change on a larger scale if I had a prestigious law degree. 
So I left. 
Three years later, when I was about to graduate from law school, my friend called me and told me that Patrick had got into a fight and killed someone. 
I was devastated. 
Part of me didn't believe it, but part of me also knew that it was true. 
I flew down to see Patrick. 
I visited him in jail. 
And he told me that it was true. 
That he had killed someone. 
And he didn't want to talk more about it. 
I asked him what had happened with school and he said that he had dropped out the year after I left. 
And then he wanted to tell me something else. 
He looked down and he said that he had had a baby daughter who was just born. 
And he felt like he had let her down. 
That was it, our conversation was rushed and awkward. 
When I stepped outside the jail, a voice inside me said, "Come back. 
If you don't come back now, you'll never come back." 
So I graduated from law school and I went back. 
I went back to see Patrick, I went back to see if I could help him with his legal case. 
And this time, when I saw him a second time, I thought I had this great idea, I said, "Hey, Patrick, why don't you write a letter to your daughter, so that you can keep her on your mind?" 
And I handed him a pen and a piece of paper, and he started to write. 
But when I saw the paper that he handed back to me, I was shocked. 
I didn't recognize his handwriting, he had made simple spelling mistakes. 
And I thought to myself that as a teacher, I knew that a student could dramatically improve in a very quick amount of time, but I never thought that a student could dramatically regress. 
What even pained me more, was seeing what he had written to his daughter. 
He had written, "I'm sorry for my mistakes, I'm sorry for not being there for you." 
And this was all he felt he had to say to her. 
And I asked myself how can I convince him that he has more to say, parts of himself that he doesn't need to apologize for. 
I wanted him to feel that he had something worthwhile to share with his daughter. 
For every day the next seven months, I visited him and brought books. 
My tote bag became a little library. 
I brought James Baldwin, I brought Walt Whitman, C.S. Lewis. 
I brought guidebooks to trees, to birds, and what would become his favorite book, the dictionary. 
On some days, we would sit for hours in silence, both of us reading. 
And on other days, we would read together, we would read poetry. 
We started by reading haikus, hundreds of haikus, a deceptively simple masterpiece. 
And I would ask him, "Share with me your favorite haikus." 
And some of them are quite funny. 
So there's this by Issa: "Don't worry, spiders, I keep house casually." 
And this: "Napped half the day, no one punished me!" 
And this gorgeous one, which is about the first day of snow falling, "Deer licking first frost from each other's coats." 
There's something mysterious and gorgeous just about the way a poem looks. 
The empty space is as important as the words themselves. 
We read this poem by W.S. Merwin, which he wrote after he saw his wife working in the garden and realized that they would spend the rest of their lives together. 
"Let me imagine that we will come again when we want to and it will be spring We will be no older than we ever were The worn griefs will have eased like the early cloud through which morning slowly comes to itself" I asked Patrick what his favorite line was, and he said, "We will be no older than we ever were." 
He said it reminded him of a place where time just stops, where time doesn't matter anymore. 
And I asked him if he had a place like that, where time lasts forever. 
And he said, "My mother." 
When you read a poem alongside someone else, the poem changes in meaning. 
Because it becomes personal to that person, becomes personal to you. 
We then read books, we read so many books, we read the memoir of Frederick Douglass, an American slave who taught himself to read and write and who escaped to freedom because of his literacy. 
I had grown up thinking of Frederick Douglass as a hero and I thought of this story as one of uplift and hope. 
But this book put Patrick in a kind of panic. 
He fixated on a story Douglass told of how, over Christmas, masters give slaves gin as a way to prove to them that they can't handle freedom. 
Because slaves would be stumbling on the fields. 
Patrick said he related to this. 
He said that there are people in jail who, like slaves, don't want to think about their condition, because it's too painful. 
Too painful to think about the past, too painful to think about how far we have to go. 
His favorite line was this line: "Anything, no matter what, to get rid of thinking! 
It was this everlasting thinking of my condition that tormented me." 
Patrick said that Douglass was brave to write, to keep thinking. 
But Patrick would never know how much he seemed like Douglass to me. 
How he kept reading, even though it put him in a panic. 
He finished the book before I did, reading it in a concrete stairway with no light. 
And then we went on to read one of my favorite books, Marilynne Robinson's "Gilead," which is an extended letter from a father to his son. 
He loved this line: "I'm writing this in part to tell you that if you ever wonder what you've done in your life ... 
you have been God's grace to me, a miracle, something more than a miracle." 
Something about this language, its love, its longing, its voice, rekindled Patrick's desire to write. 
And he would fill notebooks upon notebooks with letters to his daughter. 
In these beautiful, intricate letters, he would imagine him and his daughter going canoeing down the Mississippi river. 
He would imagine them finding a mountain stream with perfectly clear water. 
As I watched Patrick write, I thought to myself, and I now ask all of you, how many of you have written a letter to somebody you feel you have let down? 
It is just much easier to put those people out of your mind. 
But Patrick showed up every day, facing his daughter, holding himself accountable to her, word by word with intense concentration. 
I wanted in my own life to put myself at risk in that way. 
Because that risk reveals the strength of one's heart. 
Let me take a step back and just ask an uncomfortable question. 
Who am I to tell this story, as in this Patrick story? 
Patrick's the one who lived with this pain and I have never been hungry a day in my life. 
I thought about this question a lot, but what I want to say is that this story is not just about Patrick. 
It's about us, it's about the inequality between us. 
The world of plenty that Patrick and his parents and his grandparents have been shut out of. 
In this story, I represent that world of plenty. 
And in telling this story, I didn't want to hide myself. 
Hide the power that I do have. 
In telling this story, I wanted to expose that power and then to ask, how do we diminish the distance between us? 
Reading is one way to close that distance. 
It gives us a quiet universe that we can share together, that we can share in equally. 
You're probably wondering now what happened to Patrick. 
Did reading save his life? 
It did and it didn't. 
When Patrick got out of prison, his journey was excruciating. 
Employers turned him away because of his record, his best friend, his mother, died at age 43 from heart disease and diabetes. 
He's been homeless, he's been hungry. 
So people say a lot of things about reading that feel exaggerated to me. 
Being literate didn't stop him form being discriminated against. 
It didn't stop his mother from dying. 
So what can reading do? 
I have a few answers to end with today. 
Reading charged his inner life with mystery, with imagination, with beauty. 
Reading gave him images that gave him joy: mountain, ocean, deer, frost. 
Words that taste of a free, natural world. 
Reading gave him a language for what he had lost. 
How precious are these lines from the poet Derek Walcott? 
Patrick memorized this poem. 
"Days that I have held, days that I have lost, days that outgrow, like daughters, my harboring arms." 
Reading taught him his own courage. 
Remember that he kept reading Frederick Douglass, even though it was painful. 
He kept being conscious, even though being conscious hurts. 
Reading is a form of thinking, that's why it's difficult to read because we have to think. 
And Patrick chose to think, rather than to not think. 
And last, reading gave him a language to speak to his daughter. 
Reading inspired him to want to write. 
The link between reading and writing is so powerful. 
When we begin to read, we begin to find the words. 
And he found the words to imagine the two of them together. 
He found the words to tell her how much he loved her. 
Reading also changed our relationship with each other. 
It gave us an occasion for intimacy, to see beyond our points of view. 
And reading took an unequal relationship and gave us a momentary equality. 
When you meet somebody as a reader, you meet him for the first time, newly, freshly. 
There is no way you can know what his favorite line will be. 
What memories and private griefs he has. 
And you face the ultimate privacy of his inner life. 
And then you start to wonder, "Well, what is my inner life made of? 
What do I have that's worthwhile to share with another?" 
I want to close on some of my favorite lines from Patrick's letters to his daughter. 
"The river is shadowy in some places but the light shines through the cracks of trees ... 
On some branches hang plenty of mulberries. 
You stretch your arm straight out to grab some." 
And this lovely letter, where he writes, "Close your eyes and listen to the sounds of the words. 
I know this poem by heart and I would like you to know it, too." 
Thank you so much everyone. 
(Applause) 

I have a friend named Kaveh Akbar, who is a fellow poet. 
And Kaveh found this photo online of the anatomical heart of a blue whale that scientists had hung on a hook from the ceiling, which is how they were able to observe that the heart of a blue whale is big enough that a person can stand up fully inside of it. 
And when Kaveh shared this photo online, he did so with the caption, "This is another reminder that the universe has already written the poem you were planning on writing." 
And when I first saw that, I was horrified. 
I was like, "Come on, man! I'm trying to invent new metaphors! 
I'm trying to discover beauty that hasn't been discovered yet. 
What do you mean, the universe is always going to get there before me?" 
And I know this isn't a uniquely poet problem, but on days when the world feels especially big or especially impossible or especially full of grandeur, those are the days when I feel, "What do I possibly have to contribute to all of this?" 
Not long ago, I saw this video that some of you may have seen. 
It makes the internet rounds every couple of months. 
There are these birds that are called starlings, and they fly in what's called a "murmuration," which is generally just a big cloud of birds. 
And someone happened to catch a quick video on their phone of these starlings flying. 
And at first, it's just an amorphous blob, and then there's a moment where the birds shift, and they form the shape of a starling in the sky! 
(Laughter) And as soon as I saw it, I was like, (Gasps) "The universe has already written the poem you were planning on writing!" 
(Laughter) Except, for the first time, it didn't fill me with despair. 
Instead, I thought, "OK. 
Maybe it's not my job to invent something new. 
Maybe instead it's my job to listen to what the universe is showing me and to keep myself open to what the universe offers, so that when it's my turn, I can hold something to the light, just for a moment, just for as long as I have. 
The universe has already written the poem that you were planning on writing. 
And this is why you can do nothing but point at the flock of starlings whose bodies rise and fall in inherited choreography, swarming the sky in a sweeping curtain that, for one blistering moment, forms the unmistakeable shape of a giant bird flapping against the sky. 
It is why your mouth forms an "o" that is not a gasp, but rather, the beginning of, "Oh. Of course." 
As in, of course the heart of a blue whale is as large as a house with chambers tall enough to fit a person standing. 
Of course a fig becomes possible when a lady wasp lays her eggs inside a flower, dies and decomposes, the fruit, evidence of her transformation. 
Sometimes, the poem is so bright, your silly language will not stick to it. 
Sometimes, the poem is so true, nobody will believe you. 
I am a bird made of birds. 
This blue heart a house you can stand up inside of. 
I am dying here inside this flower. 
It is OK. 
It is what I was put here to do. 
Take this fruit. 
It is what I have to offer. 
It may not be first, or ever best, but it is the only way to be sure that I lived at all. 
(Applause) 

About 200 years ago, Napoleon famously warned ... 
He said, "Let China sleep, for when she wakes, she will shake the world." 
Despite this early warning, the West chose to go to sleep at precisely the moment when China and India and the rest of Asia woke up. 
I'm here to address this great mystery. 
Now what do I mean when I say the West chose to go to sleep? 
Here I'm referring to the failure of the West to react intelligently and thoughtfully to a new world environment that's obviously been created by the return of Asia. 
As a friend of the West I feel anguished by this, so my goal to today is to try to help the West. 
But I have to begin the story first by talking about how the West actually woke up the rest of the world. 
Look at chart one. 
From the year one through the year 1820, the two largest economies of the world were always those of China and India. 
So it's only in the last 200 years that Europe took off, followed by North America. 
So the past 200 years of world history have therefore been a major historical aberration. 
All aberrations come to a natural end and this is what we are seeing. 
And if you look at chart two, you'll see how quickly and how forcefully China and India are coming back. 
The big question is: Who woke up China and India? 
The only honest answer to this question is that it was Western civilization that did so. 
We all know that the West was the first to successfully modernize, transform itself; initially it used its power to colonize and dominate the world. 
But over time, it shared the gifts of Western wisdom with the rest of the world. 
Let me add here that I have personally benefited from the sharing of Western wisdom. 
When I was born in Singapore, which was then a poor British colony, in 1948, I experienced, like three-quarters of humanity then, extreme poverty. 
Indeed, on the first day when I went to school at the age of six, I was put in a special feeding program because I was technically undernourished. 
Now as you can see I'm overnourished. 
(Laughter) But the greatest gift I got was that of Western education. 
Now since I've personally traveled this journey from third world poverty to a comfortable middle-class existence, I can speak with great conviction about the impact of Western wisdom and the sharing of Western wisdom with the world. 
And one particular gift that the West shared was the art of reasoning. 
Now reasoning was not invented by the West. 
It's inherent in all cultures and civilizations. 
Amartya Sen has described how deeply embedded it is in Indian civilization. 
Yet there's also no doubt that it was the West that carried the art of reasoning to a much higher level. 
And through the Scientific Revolution, the Enlightenment, the Industrial Revolution, the West really raised it forcefully, and equally importantly used this, applied it to solve many major practical problems. 
And the West then shared this art of applied reasoning with the rest of the world, and I can tell you that it led to what I call three silent revolutions. 
And as an Asian, I can describe how these silent revolutions transformed Asia. 
The first revolution was in economics. 
The main reason why so many Asian economies, including the communist societies of China and Vietnam, have performed so spectacularly well in economic development, is because they finally understood, absorbed and are implementing free market economics -- a gift from the West. 
Adam Smith was right. 
If you let markets decide, productivity goes up. 
The second gift was psychological. 
Here too I can speak from personal experience. 
When I was young, my mother and her generation believed that life was determined by fate. 
You couldn't do anything about it. 
My generation and the generation of Asians after me, believe that we can take charge and we can improve our lives. 
And this may explain, for example, the spike of entrepreneurship you see all throughout Asia today. 
And if you travel through Asia today, you will also see the results of the third revolution: the revolution of good governance. 
Now as a result of good governance -- travel in Asia, you see better health care, better education, better infrastructure, better public policies. 
It's a different world. 
Now having transformed the world through the sharing of Western wisdom with the rest of the world, the logical and rational response of the West should have been to say, "Hey, we have to adjust and adapt to this new world." 
Instead, the West chose to go to sleep. 
Why did it happen? 
I believe it happened because the West became distracted with two major events. 
The first event was the end of the Cold War. 
Yes, the end of the Cold War was a great victory. 
The West defeated the mighty Soviet Union without firing a shot. 
Amazing. 
But you know, when you have a great victory like this, it also leads to arrogance and hubris. 
And this hubris was best captured in a very famous essay by Francis Fukuyama called "The End of History?" 
Now, Fukuyama was putting across a very sophisticated message, but all that the West heard from this essay was that we, the liberal democracies, we have succeeded, we don't have to change, we don't have to adapt, it's only the rest of the world that has to change and adapt. 
Unfortunately, like a dangerous opiate, this essay did a lot of brain damage to the West because it put them to sleep just at precisely the moment when China and India were waking up and the West didn't adjust and adapt. 
The second major event was 9/11, which happened in 2001. 
And as we know, 9/11 caused a lot of shock and grief. 
I personally experienced the shock and grief because I was in Manhattan when 9/11 happened. 
9/11 also generated a lot of anger, and in this anger, the United States decided to invade Afghanistan and later, Iraq. 
And unfortunately, partly as a result of this anger, the West didn't notice the significance of another event that happened also in 2001. 
China joined the World Trade Organization. 
Now, when you suddenly inject 900 million new workers into the global capitalist system, it would naturally lead to what the economist Joseph Schumpeter called creative destruction. 
Western workers lost their jobs, they saw their incomes stagnate, clearly people had to think about new competitive policies, workers needed retraining, workers needed new skills. 
None of this was done. 
So partly as a result of this, the United States of America became the only major developed society where the average income of the bottom 50 percent -- yes, 50 percent -- average income went down over a 30-year period, from 1980 to 2010. 
So partly, as a result of this, it led eventually to the election of Donald Trump in 2016, who exploited the anger of the working classes, who are predominantly white. 
It also contributed to the rise of populism in Europe. 
And one wonders, could this populism have been avoided if the West had not been distracted by the end of the Cold War and by 9/11? 
But the big question we face today is this: Is it too late? 
Has the West lost everything? 
And my answer is that it's not too late. 
It is possible for the West to recover and come back in strength. 
And using the Western art of reasoning, I would recommend that the West adopt a new "three-m" strategy: minimalist, multilateral and Machiavellian. 
(Laughter) Why minimalist? 
Now even though Western domination has ended, the West continues to intervene and interfere in the affairs of many other societies. 
This is unwise. 
This is generating anger and resentment, especially in Islamic societies. 
It's also draining the resources and spirits of Western societies. 
Now I know that the Islamic world is having difficulties modernizing. 
It will have to find its way, but it's more likely to do so if it is left alone to do so. 
Now I can say this with some conviction because I come from a region, Southeast Asia, which has almost as many Muslims as the Arab world. 
266 million Muslims. 
Southeast Asia is also one of the most diverse continents on planet earth, because you also have 146 million Christians, 149 million Buddhists -- Mahayana Buddhists and Hinayana Buddhists -- and you also have millions of Taoists and Confucianists and Hindus and even communists. 
And once known as "the Balkans of Asia," southeast Asia today should be experiencing a clash of civilizations. 
Instead, what you see in southeast Asia is one of the most peaceful and prosperous corners of planet earth with the second-most successful regional multilateral organization, ASEAN. 
So clearly, minimalism can work. 
The West should try it out. 
(Laughter) (Applause) But I'm also aware that minimalism cannot solve all the problems. 
There are some hard problems that have to be dealt with: Al-Qaeda, ISIS -- they remain dangerous threats. 
They must be found, they must be destroyed. 
The question is, is it wise for the West, which represents 12 percent of the world's population -- yes, 12 percent -- to fight these threats on its own or to fight with the remaining 88 percent of the world's population? 
And the logical and rational answer is that you should work with the remaining 88 percent. 
Now where does one go if you want to get the support of humanity? 
There's only one place: the United Nations. 
Now I've been ambassador to the UN twice. 
Maybe that makes me a bit biased, but I can tell you that working with the UN can lead to success. 
Why is it that the first Iraq war, fought by President George H. W. Bush, succeeded? 
While the second Iraq war, fought by his son, President George W. Bush, failed? 
One key reason is that the senior Bush went to the UN to get the support of the global community before fighting the war in Iraq. 
So multilateralism works. 
There's another reason why we have to work with the UN. 
The world is shrinking. 
We are becoming a small, interdependent, global village. 
All villages need village councils. 
And the only global village counsel we have, as the late UN Secretary-General Kofi Annan said, is the UN. 
Now as a geopolitical analyst, I do know that it's often considered naive to work with the UN. 
So now let me inject my Machiavellian point. 
Now Machiavelli is a figure who's often derided in the West, but the liberal philosopher Isaiah Berlin reminded us that the goal of Machiavelli was to promote virtue, not evil. 
So what is the Machiavellian point? 
It's this: what is the best way for the West to constrain the new rising powers that are emerging? 
And the answer is that the best way to constrain them is through multilateral rules and multilateral norms, multilateral institutions and multilateral processes. 
Now let me conclude with one final, big message. 
As a longtime friend of the West, I'm acutely aware of how pessimistic Western societies have become. 
Many in the West don't believe that a great future lies ahead for them, that their children will not have better lives. 
So please do not fear the future or the rest of the world. 
Now I can say this with some conviction, because as a Hindu Sindhi, I actually feel a direct cultural connection with society's diverse cultures and societies all the way from Tehran to Tokyo. 
And more than half of humanity lives in this space, so with this direct cultural connection, I can say with great conviction that if the West chooses to adopt a wiser strategy of being minimalist, multilateral and Machiavellian, the rest of the world will be happy to work with the West. 
So a great future lies ahead for humanity. 
Let's embrace it together. 
Thank you. 
(Applause) 

So, asking for help is basically the worst, right? 
I've actually never seen it on one of those top ten lists of things people fear, like public speaking and death, but I'm pretty sure it actually belongs there. 
Even though in many ways it's foolish for us to be afraid to admit we need help, whether it's from a loved one or a friend or from a coworker or even from a stranger, somehow it always feel just a little bit uncomfortable and embarrassing to actually ask for help, which is, of course, why most of us try to avoid asking for help whenever humanly possible. 
My father was one of those legions of fathers who, I swear, would rather drive through an alligator-infested swamp than actually ask someone for help getting back to the road. 
When I was a kid, we took a family vacation. 
We drove from our home in South Jersey to Colonial Williamsburg. 
And I remember we got really badly lost. 
My mother and I pleaded with him to please just pull over and ask someone for directions back to the highway, and he absolutely refused, and, in fact, assured us that we were not lost, he had just always wanted to know what was over here. 
(Laughter) So if we're going to ask for help -- and we have to, we all do, practically every day -- the only way we're going to even begin to get comfortable with it is to get good at it, to actually increase the chances that when you ask for help from someone, they're actually going to say yes. 
And not only that, but they're going to find it actually satisfying and rewarding to help you, because that way, they'll be motivated to continue to help you into the future. 
So research that I and some of my colleagues have done has shed a lot of light on why it is that sometimes people say yes to our requests for help and why sometimes they say no. 
Now let me just start by saying right now: if you need help, you are going to have to ask for it. 
Out loud. 
OK? 
We all, to some extent, suffer from something that psychologists call "the illusion of transparency" -- basically, the mistaken belief that our thoughts and our feelings and our needs are really obvious to other people. 
This is not true, but we believe it. 
And so, we just mostly stand around waiting for someone to notice our needs and then spontaneously offer to help us with it. 
This is a really, really bad assumption. 
In fact, not only is it very difficult to tell what your needs are, but even the people close to you often struggle to understand how they can support you. 
My partner has actually had to adopt a habit of asking me multiple times a day, "Are you OK? Do you need anything?" 
because I am so, so bad at signaling when I need someone's help. 
Now, he is more patient than I deserve and much more proactive, much more, about helping than any of us have any right to expect other people to be. 
So if you need help, you're going to have to ask for it. 
And by the way, even when someone can tell that you need help, how do they know that you want it? 
Did you ever try to give unsolicited help to someone who, it turns out, did not actually want your help in the first place? 
They get nasty real quick, don't they? 
The other day -- true story -- my teenage daughter was getting dressed for school, and I decided to give her some unsolicited help about that. 
(Laughter) I happen to think she looks amazing in brighter colors. 
She tends to prefer sort of darker, more neutral tones. 
And so I said, very helpfully, that I thought maybe she could go back upstairs and try to find something a little less somber. 
(Laughter) So, if looks could kill, I would not be standing here right now. 
We really can't blame other people for not just spontaneously offering to help us when we don't actually know that that's what is wanted. 
In fact, actually, research shows that 90 percent of the help that coworkers give one another in the workplace is in response to explicit requests for help. 
So you're going to have to say the words "I need your help." Right? 
There's no getting around it. 
Now, to be good at it, to make sure that people actually do help you when you ask for it, there are a few other things that are very helpful to keep in mind. 
First thing: when you ask for help, be very, very specific about the help you want and why. 
Vague, sort of indirect requests for help actually aren't very helpful to the helper, right? 
We don't actually know what it is you want from us, and, just as important, we don't know whether or not we can be successful in giving you the help. 
Nobody wants to give bad help. 
Like me, you probably get some of these requests from perfectly pleasant strangers on LinkedIn who want to do things like "get together over coffee and connect" or "pick your brain." 
I ignore these requests literally every time. 
And it's not that I'm not a nice person. 
It's just that when I don't know what it is you want from me, like the kind of help you're hoping that can I provide, I'm not interested. 
Nobody is. 
I'd have been much more interested if they had just come out and said whatever it is was they were hoping to get from me, because I'm pretty sure they had something specific in mind. 
So go ahead and say, "I'm hoping to discuss opportunities to work in your company," or, "I'd like to propose a joint research project in an area I know you're interested in," or, "I'd like your advice on getting into medical school." 
Technically, I can't help you with that last one because I'm not that kind of doctor, but I could point you in the direction of someone who could. 
OK, second tip. 
This is really important: please avoid disclaimers, apologies and bribes. 
Really, really important. 
Do any of these sound familiar? 
(Clears throat) 'I'm so, so sorry that I have to ask you for this." 
"I really hate bothering you with this." 
"If I had any way of doing this without your help, I would." 
(Laughter) Sometimes it feels like people are so eager to prove that they're not weak and greedy when they ask your for help, they're completely missing out on how uncomfortable they're making you feel. 
And by the way -- how am I supposed to find it satisfying to help you if you really hated having to ask me for help? 
And while it is perfectly, perfectly acceptable to pay strangers to do things for you, you need to be very, very careful when it comes to incentivizing your friends and coworkers. 
When you have a relationship with someone, helping one another is actually a natural part of that relationship. 
It's how we show one another that we care. 
If you introduce incentives or payments into that, what can happen is, it starts to feel like it isn't a relationship, it's a transaction. 
And that actually is experienced as distancing, which, ironically, makes people less likely to help you. 
So a spontaneous gift after someone gives you some help to show your appreciation and gratitude -- perfectly fine. 
An offer to pay your best friend to help you move into your new apartment is not. 
OK, third rule, and I really mean this one: please do not ask for help over email or text. 
Really, seriously, please don't. 
Email and text are impersonal. 
I realize sometimes there's no alternative, but mostly what happens is, we like to ask for help over email and text because it feels less awkward for us to do so. 
You know what else feels less awkward over email and text? 
Telling you no. 
And it turns out, there's research to support this. 
In-person requests for help are 30 times more likely to get a yes than a request made by email. 
So when something is really important and you really need someone's help, make face time to make the request, or use your phone as a phone -- (Laughter) to ask for the help that you need. 
OK. 
Last one, and this is actually a really, really important one and probably the one that is most overlooked when it comes to asking for help: when you ask someone for their help and they say yes, follow up with them afterward. 
There's a common misconception that what's rewarding about helping is the act of helping itself. 
This is not true. 
What is rewarding about helping is knowing that your help landed, that it had impact, that you were effective. 
If I have no idea how my help affected you, how am I supposed to feel about it? 
This happened; I was a university professor for many years, I wrote lots and lots of letters of recommendation for people to get jobs or to go into graduate school. 
And probably about 95 percent of them, I have no idea what happened. 
Now, how do I feel about the time and effort I took to do that, when I really have no idea if I helped you, if it actually helped you get the thing that you wanted? 
In fact, this idea of feeling effective is part of why certain kinds of donor appeals are so, so persuasive -- because they allow you to really vividly imagine the effect that your help is going to have. 
Take something like DonorsChoose. 
You go online, you can choose the individual teacher by name whose classroom you're going to be able to help by literally buying the specific items they've requested, like microscopes or laptops or flexible seating. 
An appeal like that makes it so easy for me to imagine the good that my money will do, that I actually get an immediate sense of effectiveness the minute I commit to giving. 
But you know what else they do? 
They follow up. 
Donors actually get letters from the kids in the classroom. 
They get pictures. 
They get to know that they made a difference. 
And this is something we need to all be doing in our everyday lives, especially if we want people to continue to give us help over the long term. 
Take time to tell your colleague that the help that they gave you really helped you land that big sale, or helped you get that interview that you were really hoping to get. 
Take time to tell your partner that the support they gave you really made it possible for you to get through a tough time. 
Take time to tell your catsitter that you're super happy that for some reason, this time the cats didn't break anything while you were away, and so they must have done a really good job. 
The bottom line is: I know -- believe me, I know -- that it is not easy to ask for help. 
We are all a little bit afraid to do it. 
It makes us feel vulnerable. 
But the reality of modern work and modern life is that nobody does it alone. 
Nobody succeeds in a vacuum. 
More than ever, we actually do have to rely on other people, on their support and collaboration, in order to be successful. 
So when you need help, ask for it out loud. 
And when you do, do it in a way that increases your chances that you'll get a yes and makes the other person feel awesome for having helped you, because you both deserve it. 
Thank you. 
(Applause) 

Hello. 
I'd like to introduce you to someone. 
This is Jomny. 
That's "Jonny" but spelled accidentally with an "m," in case you were wondering, because we're not all perfect. 
Jomny is an alien who has been sent to earth with a mission to study humans. 
Jomny is feeling lost and alone and far from home, and I think we've all felt this way. 
Or, at least I have. 
I wrote this story about this alien at a moment in my life when I was feeling particularly alien. 
I had just moved to Cambridge and started my doctoral program at MIT, and I was feeling intimidated and isolated and very much like I didn't belong. 
But I had a lifeline of sorts. 
See, I was writing jokes for years and years and sharing them on social media, and I found that I was turning to doing this more and more. 
Now, for many people, the internet can feel like a lonely place. 
It can feel like this, a big, endless, expansive void where you can constantly call out to it but no one's ever listening. 
But I actually found a comfort in speaking out to the void. 
I found, in sharing my feelings with the void, eventually the void started to speak back. 
And it turns out that the void isn't this endless lonely expanse at all, but instead it's full of all sorts of other people, also staring out into it and also wanting to be heard. 
Now, there have been many bad things that have come from social media. 
I'm not trying to dispute that at all. 
To be online at any given point is to feel so much sadness and anger and violence. 
It can feel like the end of the world. 
Yet, at the same time, I'm conflicted because I can't deny the fact that so many of my closest friends are people that I had met originally online. 
And I think that's partly because there's this confessional nature to social media. 
It can feel like you are writing in this personal, intimate diary that's completely private, yet at the same time you want everyone in the world to read it. 
And I think part of that, the joy of that is that we get to experience things from perspectives from people who are completely different from ourselves, and sometimes that's a nice thing. 
For example, when I first joined Twitter, I found that so many of the people that I was following were talking about mental health and going to therapy in ways that had none of the stigma that they often do when we talk about these issues in person. 
Through them, the conversation around mental health was normalized, and they helped me realize that going to therapy was something that would help me as well. 
Now, for many people, it sounds like a scary idea to be talking about all these topics so publicly and so openly on the internet. 
I feel like a lot of people think that it is a big, scary thing to be online if you're not already perfectly and fully formed. 
But I think the internet can be actually a great place to not know, and I think we can treat that with excitement, because to me there's something important about sharing your imperfections and your insecurities and your vulnerabilities with other people. 
(Laughter) Now, when someone shares that they feel sad or afraid or alone, for example, it actually makes me feel less alone, not by getting rid of any of my loneliness but by showing me that I am not alone in feeling lonely. 
And as a writer and as an artist, I care very much about making this comfort of being vulnerable a communal thing, something that we can share with each other. 
I'm excited about externalizing the internal, about taking those invisible personal feelings that I don't have words for, holding them to the light, putting words to them, and then sharing them with other people in the hopes that it might help them find words to find their feelings as well. 
Now, I know that sounds like a big thing, but ultimately I'm interested in putting all these things into small, approachable packages, because when we can hide them into these smaller pieces, I think they are easier to approach, I think they're more fun. 
I think they can more easily help us see our shared humanness. 
Sometimes that takes the form of a short story, sometimes that takes the form of a cute book of illustrations, for example. 
And sometimes that takes the form of a silly joke that I'll throw on the internet. 
For example, a few months ago, I posted this app idea for a dog-walking service where a dog shows up at your door and you have to get out of the house and go for a walk. 
(Laughter) If there are app developers in the audience, please find me after the talk. 
Or, I like to share every time I feel anxious about sending an email. 
When I sign my emails "Best," it's short for "I am trying my best," which is short for "Please don't hate me, I promise I'm trying my best!" 
Or my answer to the classic icebreaker, if I could have dinner with anyone, dead or alive, I would. 
I am very lonely. 
(Laughter) And I find that when I post things like these online, the reaction is very similar. 
People come together to share a laugh, to share in that feeling, and then to disburse just as quickly. 
(Laughter) Yes, leaving me once again alone. 
But I think sometimes these little gatherings can be quite meaningful. 
For example, when I graduated from architecture school and I moved to Cambridge, I posted this question: "How many people in your life have you already had your last conversation with?" 
And I was thinking about my own friends who had moved away to different cities and different countries, even, and how hard it would be for me to keep in touch with them. 
But other people started replying and sharing their own experiences. 
Somebody talked about a family member they had a falling out with. 
Someone talked about a loved one who had passed away quickly and unexpectedly. 
Someone else talked about their friends from school who had moved away as well. 
But then something really nice started happening. 
Instead of just replying to me, people started replying to each other, and they started to talk to each other and share their own experiences and comfort each other and encourage each other to reach out to that friend that they hadn't spoken to in a while or that family member that they had a falling out with. 
And eventually, we got this little tiny microcommunity. 
It felt like this support group formed of all sorts of people coming together. 
And I think every time we post online, every time we do this, there's a chance that these little microcommunities can form. 
There's a chance that all sorts of different creatures can come together and be drawn together. 
And sometimes, through the muck of the internet, you get to find a kindred spirit. 
Sometimes that's in the reading the replies and the comments sections and finding a reply that is particularly kind or insightful or funny. 
Sometimes that's in going to follow someone and seeing that they already follow you back. 
And sometimes that's in looking at someone that you know in real life and seeing the things that you write and the things that they write and realizing that you share so many of the same interests as they do, and that brings them closer together to you. 
Sometimes, if you're lucky, you get to meet another alien. 
[when two aliebns find each other in a strange place, it feels a litle more like home] But I am worried, too, because as we all know, the internet for the most part doesn't feel like this. 
We all know that for the most part, the internet feels like a place where we misunderstand each other, where we come into conflict with each other, where there's all sorts of confusion and screaming and yelling and shouting, and it feels like there's too much of everything. 
It feels like chaos, and I don't know how to square away the bad parts with the good, because as we know and as we've seen, the bad parts can really, really hurt us. 
It feels to me that the platforms that we use to inhabit these online spaces have been designed either ignorantly or willfully to allow for harassment and abuse, to propagate misinformation, to enable hatred and hate speech and the violence that comes from it, and it feels like none of our current platforms are doing enough to address and to fix that. 
But still, and maybe probably unfortunately, I'm still drawn to these online spaces, as many others are, because sometimes it just feels like that's where all the people are. 
And I feel silly and stupid sometimes for valuing these small moments of human connection in times like these. 
But I've always operated under this idea that these little moments of humanness are not superfluous. 
They're not retreats from the world at all, but instead they're the reasons why we come to these spaces. 
They are important and vital and they affirm and they give us life. 
And they are these tiny, temporary sanctuaries that show us that we are not as alone as we think we are. 
And so yes, even though life is bad and everyone's sad and one day we're all going to die -- [look. life is bad. everyones sad. 
We're all gona die, but i alredy bought this inflatable bouncey castle so are u gona take Ur shoes off or not] I think the inflatable metaphorical bouncy castle in this case is really our relationships and our connections to other people. 
And so one night, when I was feeling particularly sad and hopeless about the world, I shouted out to the void, to the lonely darkness. 
I said, "At this point, logging on to social media feels like holding someone's hand at the end of the world." 
And this time, instead of the void responding, it was people who showed up, who started replying to me and then who started talking to each other, and slowly this little tiny community formed. 
Everybody came together to hold hands. 
And in these dangerous and unsure times, in the midst of it all, I think the thing that we have to hold on to is other people. 
And I know that is a small thing made up of small moments, but I think it is one tiny, tiny sliver of light in all the darkness. 
Thank you. 
(Applause) Thank you. 
(Applause) 

As a roboticist, I get asked a lot of questions. 
"When we will they start serving me breakfast?" 
So I thought the future of robotics would be looking more like us. 
I thought they would look like me, so I built eyes that would simulate my eyes. 
I built fingers that are dextrous enough to serve me ... 
baseballs. 
Classical robots like this are built and become functional based on the fixed number of joints and actuators. 
And this means their functionality and shape are already fixed at the moment of their conception. 
So even though this arm has a really nice throw -- it even hit the tripod at the end-- it's not meant for cooking you breakfast per se. 
It's not really suited for scrambled eggs. 
So this was when I was hit by a new vision of future robotics: the transformers. 
They drive, they run, they fly, all depending on the ever-changing, new environment and task at hand. 
To make this a reality, you really have to rethink how robots are designed. 
So, imagine a robotic module in a polygon shape and using that simple polygon shape to reconstruct multiple different forms to create a new form of robot for different tasks. 
In CG, computer graphics, it's not any news -- it's been done for a while, and that's how most of the movies are made. 
But if you're trying to make a robot that's physically moving, it's a completely new story. 
It's a completely new paradigm. 
But you've all done this. 
Who hasn't made a paper airplane, paper boat, paper crane? 
Origami is a versatile platform for designers. 
From a single sheet of paper, you can make multiple shapes, and if you don't like it, you unfold and fold back again. 
Any 3D form can be made from 2D surfaces by folding, and this is proven mathematically. 
And imagine if you were to have an intelligent sheet that can self-fold into any form it wants, anytime. 
And that's what I've been working on. 
I call this robotic origami, "robogami." 
This is our first robogami transformation that was made by me about 10 years ago. 
From a flat-sheeted robot, it turns into a pyramid and back into a flat sheet and into a space shuttle. 
Quite cute. 
Ten years later, with my group of ninja origami robotic researchers -- about 22 of them right now -- we have a new generation of robogamis, and they're a little more effective and they do more than that. 
So the new generation of robogamis actually serve a purpose. 
For example, this one actually navigates through different terrains autonomously. 
So when it's a dry and flat land, it crawls. 
And if it meets sudden rough terrain, it starts rolling. 
It does this -- it's the same robot -- but depending on which terrain it meets, it activates a different sequence of actuators that's on board. 
And once it meets an obstacle, it jumps over it. 
It does this by storing energy in each of its legs and releasing it and catapulting like a slingshot. 
And it even does gymnastics. 
Yay. 
(Laughter) So I just showed you what a single robogami can do. 
Imagine what they can do as a group. 
They can join forces to tackle more complex tasks. 
Each module, either active or passive, we can assemble them to create different shapes. 
Not only that, by controlling the folding joints, we're able to create and attack different tasks. 
The form is making new task space. 
And this time, what's most important is the assembly. 
They need to autonomously find each other in a different space, attach and detach, depending on the environment and task. 
And we can do this now. 
So what's next? 
Our imagination. 
This is a simulation of what you can achieve with this type of module. 
We decided that we were going to have a four-legged crawler turn into a little dog and make small gaits. 
With the same module, we can actually make it do something else: a manipulator, a typical, classical robotic task. 
So with a manipulator, it can pick up an object. 
Of course, you can add more modules to make the manipulator legs longer to attack or pick up objects that are bigger or smaller, or even have a third arm. 
For robogamis, there's no one fixed shape nor task. 
They can transform into anything, anywhere, anytime. 
So how do you make them? 
The biggest technical challenge of robogami is keeping them super thin, flexible, but still remaining functional. 
They're composed of multiple layers of circuits, motors, microcontrollers and sensors, all in the single body, and when you control individual folding joints, you'll be able to achieve soft motions like that upon your command. 
Instead of being a single robot that is specifically made for a single task, robogamis are optimized to do multi-tasks. 
And this is quite important for the difficult and unique environments on the Earth as well as in space. 
Space is a perfect environment for robogamis. 
You cannot afford to have one robot for one task. 
Who knows how many tasks you will encounter in space? 
What you want is a single robotic platform that can transform to do multi-tasks. 
What we want is a deck of thin robogami modules that can transform to do multiples of performing tasks. 
And don't take my word for it, because the European Space Agency and Swiss Space Center are sponsoring this exact concept. 
So here you see a couple of images of reconfiguration of robogamis, exploring the foreign land aboveground, on the surface, as well as digging into the surface. 
It's not just exploration. 
For astronauts, they need additional help, because you cannot afford to bring interns up there, either. 
(Laughter) They have to do every tedious task. 
They may be simple, but super interactive. 
So you need robots to facilitate their experiments, assisting them with the communications and just docking onto surfaces to be their third arm holding different tools. 
But how will they be able to control robogamis, for example, outside the space station? 
In this case, I show a robogami that is holding space debris. 
You can work with your vision so that you can control them, but what would be better is having the sensation of touch directly transported onto the hands of the astronauts. 
And what you need is a haptic device, a haptic interface that recreates the sensation of touch. 
And using robogamis, we can do this. 
This is the world's smallest haptic interface that can recreate a sensation of touch just underneath your fingertip. 
We do this by moving the robogami by microscopic and macroscopic movements at the stage. 
And by having this, not only will you be able to feel how big the object is, the roundness and the lines, but also the stiffness and the texture. 
Alex has this interface just underneath his thumb, and if he were to use this with VR goggles and hand controllers, now the virtual reality is no longer virtual. 
It becomes a tangible reality. 
The blue ball, red ball and black ball that he's looking at is no longer differentiated by colors. 
Now it is a rubber blue ball, sponge red ball and billiard black ball. 
This is now possible. 
Let me show you. 
This is really the first time this is shown live in front of a public grand audience, so hopefully this works. 
So what you see here is an atlas of anatomy and the robogami haptic interface. 
So, like all the other reconfigurable robots, it multitasks. 
Not only is it going to serve as a mouse, but also a haptic interface. 
So for example, we have a white background where there is no object. 
That means there is nothing to feel, so we can have a very, very flexible interface. 
Now, I use this as a mouse to approach skin, a muscular arm, so now let's feel his biceps, or shoulders. 
So now you see how much stiffer it becomes. 
Let's explore even more. 
Let's approach the ribcage. 
And as soon as I move on top of the ribcage and between the intercostal muscles, which is softer and harder, I can feel the difference of the stiffness. 
Take my word for it. 
So now you see, it's much stiffer in terms of the force it's giving back to my fingertip. 
So I showed you the surfaces that aren't moving. 
How about if I were to approach something that moves, for example, like a beating heart? 
What would I feel? 
(Applause) This can be your beating heart. 
This can actually be inside your pocket while you're shopping online. 
Now you'll be able to feel the difference of the sweater that you're buying, how soft it is, if it's actually cashmere or not, or the bagel that you're trying to buy, how hard it is or how crispy it is. 
This is now possible. 
The robotics technology is advancing to be more personalized and adaptive, to adapt to our everyday needs. 
This unique specie of reconfigurable robotics is actually the platform to provide this invisible, intuitive interface to meet our exact needs. 
These robots will no longer look like the characters from the movies. 
Instead, they will be whatever you want them to be. 
Thank you. 
(Applause) 

This is my favorite protest shirt. 
It says, "Protect your people." 
We made it in the basement of our community center. 
I've worn it at rallies, at protests and marches, at candlelight vigils with families who have lost loved ones to police violence. 
I've seen how this ethic of community organizing has been able to change arresting practices, hold individual officers accountable and allow families to feel strong and supported in the darkest moments of their lives. 
But when a family would come to our center and say, "My loved one got arrested, what can we do?" 
we didn't know how to translate the power of community organizing that we saw on the streets into the courts. 
We figured we're not lawyers, and so that's not our arena to make change. 
And so despite our belief in collective action, we would allow people that we cared about to go to court alone. 
Nine out of ten times -- and this is true nationally -- they couldn't afford their own attorney, and so they'd have a public defender, who is doing heroic work, but was often under-resourced and stretched bare with too many cases. 
They would face prosecutors aiming for high conviction rates, mandatory minimum sentences and racial bias baked into every stage of the process. 
And so, facing those odds, stripped away from the power of community, unsure how to navigate the courts, over 90 percent of people that face a criminal charge in this country will take a plea deal. 
Meaning, they'll never have their fabled day in court that we talk about in television shows and in movies. 
And this is the untold part of the story of mass incarceration in America -- how we became the largest jailer in the world. 
Over two million people currently incarcerated in this country. 
And projections that say one out of three black men will see the inside of a prison cell at some point in their life on this trajectory. 
But we have a solution. 
We decided to be irreverent to this idea that only lawyers can impact the courts. 
And to penetrate the judicial system with the power, intellect and ingenuity of community organizing. 
We call the approach "participatory defense." 
It's a methodology for families and communities whose loved ones are facing charges, and how they could impact the outcome of those cases and transform the landscape of power in the courts. 
How it works is, families whose loved ones are facing criminal charges will come to a weekly meeting, and it's half support group, half strategic planning session. 
And they'll build a community out of what otherwise would be an isolating and lonely experience. 
And they'll sit in a circle, and write the names of their loved ones on a board, who they're there to support. 
And collectively, the group will find out ways to tangibly and tactfully impact the outcome of that case. 
They'll review police reports to find out inconsistencies; they'll find areas that require more investigation by the defense attorney; and they'll go to court with each other, for the emotional support but also so that the judge knows that the person standing before them is part of a larger community that is invested in their well-being and success. 
And the results have been remarkable. 
We've seen charges get dismissed, sentences significantly reduced, acquittals won at trial and, sometimes, it has been literally lifesaving. 
Like in the case of Ramon Vasquez. 
Father of two, family man, truck driver and someone who was wrongfully charged with a gang-related murder he was totally innocent of, but was facing a life sentence. 
Ramon's family came to those meetings shortly after his arrest and his detention, and they worked the model. 
And through their hard work, they found major contradictions in the case, gaping holes in the investigation. 
And were able to disprove dangerous assumptions by the detectives. 
Like that the red hat that they found when they raided his home somehow affiliated him to a gang lifestyle. 
Through their photos and their records, they were able to prove that the red hat was from his son's Little League team that Ramon coached on the weekends. 
And they produced independent information that proved that Ramon was on the other side of town at the time of the alleged incident, through their phone records and receipts from the stores that they attended. 
After seven long months of hard work from the family, Ramon staying strong inside jail, they were able to get the charge dismissed. 
And they brought Ramon home to live the life that he should have been living all along. 
And with each new case, the families identified new ways to flex the knowledge of the community to have impact on the court system. 
We would go to a lot of sentencing hearings. 
And when we would leave the sentencing hearing, on the walk back to the parking lot after someone's loved one just got sent to prison, the most common refrain we would hear wasn't so much, "I hate that judge," or "I wish we had a new lawyer." 
What they would say was, "I wish they knew him like we know him." 
And so we developed tools and vehicles for families to tell the fuller story of their loved one so they would be understood as more than just a case file. 
They started making what we call social biography packets, which is families making a compilation of photos and certificates and letters that show past challenges and hardships and accomplishments, and future prospects and opportunities. 
And the social biography [packets] were working so well in the courts, that we evolved it into social biography videos. 
Ten-minute mini documentaries, which were interviews of people in their homes, and at their churches and at their workplace, explaining who the person was in the backdrop of their lives. 
And it was a way for us to dissolve the walls of the court temporarily. 
And through the power of video, bring the judge out of the court and into the community, so that they would be able to understand the fuller context of someone's life that they're deciding the fate of. 
One of the first social biography projects that came out of our camp was by Carnell. 
He had come to the meetings because he had pled to a low-level drug charge. 
And after years of sobriety, got arrested for this one drug possession charge. 
But he was facing a five-year prison sentence because of the sentencing schemes in California. 
We knew him primarily as a dad. 
He'd bring his daughters to the meetings and then play with them at the park across the street. 
And he said, "Look, I could do the time, but if I go in, they're going to take my girls." 
And so we gave him a camera and said, "Just take pictures of what's like being a father." 
And so he took pictures of making breakfast for his daughters and taking them to school, taking them to after-school programs and doing homework. 
And it became this photo essay that he turned in to his lawyer who used it at the sentencing hearing. 
And that judge, who originally indicated a five-year prison sentence, understood Carnell in a whole new way. 
And he converted that five-year prison sentence into a six-month outpatient program, so that Carnell could be with his daughters. 
His girls would have a father in their life. 
And Carnell could get the treatment that he was actually seeking. 
We have one ceremony of sorts that we use in participatory defense. 
And I told you earlier that when families come to the meetings, they write the names of their loved ones on the board. 
Those are names that we all get to know, week in, week out, through the stories of the family, and we're rooting for and praying for and hoping for. 
And when we win a case, when we get a sentence reduced, or a charge dropped, or we win an acquittal, that person, who's been a name on the board, comes to the meeting. 
And when their name comes up, they're given an eraser, and they walk over to the board and they erase their name. 
And it sounds simple, but it is a spiritual experience. 
And people are applauding, and they're crying. 
And for the families that are just starting that journey and are sitting in the back of the room, for them to know that there's a finish line, that one day, they too might be able to bring their loved one home, that they could erase the name, is profoundly inspiring. 
We're training organizations all over the country now in participatory defense. 
And we have a national network of over 20 cities. 
And it's a church in Pennsylvania, it's a parents' association in Tennessee, it's a youth center in Los Angeles. 
And the latest city that we just added to the national network to grow and deepen this practice is Philadelphia. 
They literally just started their first weekly participatory defense meeting last week. 
And the person that we brought from California to Philadelphia to share their testimony, to inspire them to know what's possible, was Ramon Vasquez, who went from sitting in a jail in Santa Clara County, California, to inspiring a community about what's possible through the perseverance of community across the country. 
And with all the hubs, we still use one metric that we invented. 
It's called time saved. 
It's a saying that we actually still say at weekly meetings. 
And what we say when a family comes in a meeting for the first time is: if you do nothing, the system is designed to give your loved one time served. 
That's the language the system uses to quantify time of incarceration. 
But if you engage, if you participate, you can turn time served into time saved. 
That's them home with you, living the life they should be living. 
So, Carnell, for example, would represent five years of time saved. 
So when we totaled our time saved numbers from all the different participatory defense hubs, through the work in the meetings and at court and making social biography videos and packets, we had 4,218 years of time saved from incarceration. 
That is parents' and children's lives. 
Young people going to college instead of prison. 
We're ending generational cycles of suffering. 
And when you consider in my home state of California, it costs 60,000 dollars to house someone in the California prison system, that means that these families are saving their states a ton of money. 
I'm not a mathematician, I haven't done the numbers, but that is money and resources that could be reallocated to mental health services, to drug treatment programs, to education. 
And we're now wearing this shirt in courts all across the country. 
And people are wearing this shirt because they want the immediacy of protecting their people in the courtroom. 
But what we're telling them is, as practitioners, they're building a new field, a new movement that is going to forever change the way justice is understood in this country. 
Thank you. 
(Applause) 

A few years ago, I was taking care of a woman who was a victim of violence. 
I wanted her to be seen in a clinic that specialized in trauma survivors. 
I made the appointment myself because, being the director of the department, I knew if I did it, she would get an appointment right away. 
The clinic was about an hour and a half away from where she lived. 
But she took down the address and agreed to go. 
Unfortunately, she didn't make it to the clinic. 
When I spoke to the psychiatrist, he explained to me that trauma survivors are often resistant to dealing with the difficult issues that they face and often miss appointments. 
For this reason, they don't generally allow the doctors to make appointments for the patients. 
They had made a special exception for me. 
When I spoke to my patient, she had a much simpler and less Freudian explanation of why she didn't go to that appointment: her ride didn't show. 
Now, some of you may be thinking, "Didn't she have some other way of getting to that clinic appointment?" 
Couldn't she have taken an Uber or called another friend? 
If you're thinking that, it's probably because you have resources. 
But she didn't have enough money for an Uber, and she didn't have another friend to call. 
But she did have me, and I was able to get her another appointment, which she kept without difficulty. 
She wasn't resistant, it's just that her ride didn't show. 
I wish I could say that this was an isolated incident, but I know from running the safety net systems in San Francisco, Los Angeles, and now New York City, that health care is built on a middle-class model that often doesn't meet the needs of low-income patients. 
That's one of the reasons why it's been so difficult for us to close the disparity in health care that exists along economic lines, despite the expansion of health insurance under the ACA, or Obamacare. 
Health care in the United States assumes that, besides getting across the large land expanse of Los Angeles, it also assumes that you can take off from work in the middle of the day to get care. 
One of the patients who came to my East Los Angeles clinic on a Thursday afternoon presented with partial blindness in both eyes. 
Very concerned, I said to him, "When did this develop?" 
He said, "Sunday." 
I said, "Sunday? 
Did you think of coming sooner to clinic?" 
And he said, "Well, I have to work in order to pay the rent." 
A second patient to that same clinic, a trucker, drove three days with a raging infection, only coming to see me after he had delivered his merchandise. 
Both patients' care was jeopardized by their delays in seeking care. 
Health care in the United States assumes that you speak English or can bring someone with you who can. 
In San Francisco, I took care of a patient on the inpatient service who was from West Africa and spoke a dialect so unusual that we could only find one translator on the telephonic line who could understand him. 
And that translator only worked one afternoon a week. 
Unfortunately, my patient needed translation services every day. 
Health care in the United States assumes that you are literate. 
I learned that a patient of mine who spoke English without accent was illiterate, when he asked me to please sign a social security disability form for him right away. 
The form needed to go to the office that same day, and I wasn't in clinic, so trying to help him out, knowing that he was the sole caretaker of his son, I said, "Well, bring the form to my administrative office. 
I'll sign it and I'll fax it in for you." 
He took the two buses to my office, dropped off the form, went back home to take care of his son ... 
I got to the office, and what did I find next to the big "X" on the form? 
The word "applicant." 
He needed to sign the form. 
And so now I had to have him take the two buses back to the office and sign the form so that we could then fax it in for him. 
It completely changed how I took care of him. 
I made sure that I always went over instructions verbally with him. 
It also made me think about all of the patients who receive reams and reams of paper spit out by our modern electronic health record systems, explaining their diagnoses and their treatments, and wondering how many people actually can understand what's on those pieces of paper. 
Health care in the United States assumes that you have a working telephone and an accurate address. 
The proliferation of inexpensive cell phones has actually helped quite a lot. 
But still, my patients run out of minutes, and their phones get disconnected. 
Low-income people often have to move around a lot by necessity. 
I remember reviewing a chart of a woman with an abnormality on her mammogram. 
That chart assiduously documents that three letters were sent to her home, asking her to please come in for follow-up. 
Of course, if the address isn't accurate, it doesn't much matter how many letters you send to that same address. 
Health care in the United States assumes that you have a steady supply of food. 
This is particularly an issue for diabetics. 
We give them medications that lower their blood sugar. 
On days when they don't have enough food, it puts them at risk for a life-threatening side effect of hypoglycemia, or low blood sugar. 
Health care in the United States assumes that you have a home with a refrigerator for your insulin, a bathroom where you can wash up, a bed where you can sleep without worrying about violence while you're resting. 
But what if you don't have that? 
What if you live on the street, you live under the freeway, you live in a congregant shelter, where every morning you have to leave at 7 or 8am? 
Where do you store your medicines? 
Where do you use the bathroom? 
How do you put your legs up if you have congestive heart failure? 
Is it any wonder that providing people with health insurance who are homeless does not erase the huge disparity between the homeless and the housed? 
Health care in the United States assumes that you prioritize your health care. 
But what about all of you? 
Let me assume for a moment that you're all taking a medication. 
Maybe it's for high blood pressure. 
Maybe it's for diabetes or depression. 
What if tonight you had a choice: you could have your medication but live on the street, or you could be housed in your home but not have your medication. 
Which would you choose? 
I know which one I would choose. 
This is just a graphic example of the kinds of choices that low-income patients have to make every day. 
So when my doctors shake their heads and say, "I don't know why that patient didn't keep his follow-up appointments," "I don't know why she didn't go for that exam that I ordered," I think, well, maybe her ride didn't show, or maybe he had to work. 
But also, maybe there was something more important that day than their high blood pressure or a screening colonoscopy. 
Maybe that patient was dealing with an abusive spouse or a daughter who is pregnant and drug-addicted or a son who was kicked out of school. 
Or even maybe they were riding their bicycle through an intersection and got hit by a truck, and now they're using a wheelchair and have very limited mobility. 
Obviously, these things also happen to middle-class people. 
But when they do, we have resources that enable us to deal with these problems. 
We also have the belief that we will live out our normal lifespans. 
That's not true for low-income people. 
They've seen their friends and relatives die young of accidents, of violence, of cancers that should have been diagnosed at an earlier stage. 
It can lead to a sense of hopelessness, that it doesn't really matter what you do. 
I know I've painted a bleak picture of the care of low-income patients. 
But I want you to know how rewarding I find it to work in a safety net system, and my deep belief is that we can make the system responsive to the needs of low-income patients. 
The starting point has to be to meet patients where they are, provide services without obstacles and provide patients what they need -- not what we think they need. 
It's impossible for me to take good care of a patient who is homeless and living on the street. 
The right prescription for a homeless patient is housing. 
In Los Angeles, we housed 4,700 chronically homeless persons suffering from medical illness, mental illness, addiction. 
When we housed them, we found that overall health care costs, including the housing, decreased. 
That's because they had many fewer hospital visits, both in the emergency room and on the inpatient service. 
And we gave them back their dignity. 
No extra charge for that. 
For people who do not have a steady supply of food, especially those who are diabetic, safety net systems are experimenting with a variety of solutions, including food pantries at primary care clinics and distributing maps of community food banks and soup kitchens. 
And in New York City, we've hired a bunch of enrollers to get our patients into the supplemental nutrition program known as "food stamps" to most people. 
When patients and doctors don't understand each other, mistakes will occur. 
For non-English-speaking patients, translation is as important as a prescription pad. 
Perhaps more important. 
And, you know, it doesn't cost anything more to put all of the materials at the level of fourth-grade reading, so that everybody can understand what's being said. 
But more than anything else, I think low-income patients benefit from having a primary care doctor. 
Mind you, I think middle-class people also benefit from having somebody to quarterback their care. 
But when they don't, they have others who can advocate for them, who can get them that disability placard or make sure the disability application is completed. 
But low-income people really need a team of people who can help them to access the medical and non-medical services that they need. 
Also, many low-income people are disenfranchised from other community supports, and they really benefit from the care and continuity provided by primary care. 
A primary care doctor I particularly admire once told me how she believed that her relationship with a patient over a decade was the only healthy relationship that that patient had in her life. 
The good news is, you don't actually have to be a doctor to provide that special sauce of care and continuity. 
This was really brought home to me when one of my own long-term patients died at an outside hospital. 
I had to tell the other doctors and nurses in my clinic that he had passed. 
But I didn't know that in another part of our clinic, on a different floor, there was a registration clerk who had developed a very special relationship with my patient every time he came in for an appointment. 
When she learned three weeks later that he had died, she came and found me in my examining room, tears streaming down her cheeks, talking about my patient and the memories that she had of him, the kinds of discussions that they had had about their lives together. 
My patient had a hard life. 
He was by his own admission a gangbanger. 
He had spent a substantial amount of time in prison. 
He suffered from a very serious illness. 
He was a drug addict. 
But despite all that, he rarely missed a visit, and I like to believe that was because he knew at our clinic that he was loved. 
When our health care systems have the same commitment to low-income patients that that man had to us, two things will happen. 
First, the system will be responsive to the needs of low-income people. 
It will speak their language, it will meet their schedules, it will fulfill their needs. 
Second, we will be providing the kind of care that we went into this profession to do -- not just checking the boxes, but really taking care of those we serve. 
Thank you. 
(Applause) 

On this planet today, there are about 50 cities that are larger than five million people. 
I'm going to share with you the story of one such city, a city of seven million people, but a city that's a temporary megacity, an ephemeral megacity. 
This is a city that is built for a Hindu religious festival called Kumbh Mela, which occurs every 12 years, in smaller editions every four years, and takes place at the confluence of the Ganges and the Yamuna rivers in India. 
And for this festival, about 100 million people congregate. 
The reason so many people congregate here, is the Hindus believe that during the festival, the cycle every 12 years, if you bathe at the confluence of these two great rivers you are freed from rebirth. 
It's a really compelling idea, you are liberated from life as we know it. 
And this is what attracts these millions. 
And an entire megacity is built to house them. 
Seven million people live there for the 55 days, and the other 100 million visit. 
These are images from the same spot that we took over the 10 weeks that it takes for the city to emerge. 
After the monsoon, as the waters of these rivers begin to recede and the sand banks expose themselves, it becomes the terrain for the city. 
And by the 15th of January, starting 15th of October to 15th of January, in these weeks an entire city emerges. 
A city that houses seven million people. 
What is fascinating is this city actually has all the characteristics of a real megacity: a grid is employed to lay the city out. 
The urban system is a grid and every street on this city goes across the river on a pontoon bridge. 
Incredibly resilient, because if there's an unseasonal downpour or if the river changes course, the urban system stays intact, the city adjusts itself to this terrain which can be volatile. 
It also replicates all forms of physical, as well as social, infrastructure. 
Water supply, sewage, electricity, there are 1,400 CCTV cameras that are used for security by an entire station that is set up. 
But also social infrastructure, like clinics, hospitals, all sorts of community services, that make this function like any real megacity would do. 
10,500 sweepers are employed by the city. 
It has a governance system, a Mela Adhikari, or the commissioner of the festival, that ensures that land is allocated, there are systems for all of this, that the system of the city, the mobility, all works efficiently. 
You know, it was the cleanest and the most efficient Indian city I've lived in. 
(Laughter) And that's what it looks like in comparison to Manhattan, 30 square kilometers, that's the scale of the city. 
And this is not an informal city or a pop-up city. 
This is a formal city, this is a state enterprise, the government sets this up. 
In today's world of neoliberalism and capitalism, where the state has devolved itself complete responsibility from making and designing cities, this is an incredible case. 
It's a deliberate, intentional city, a formal city. 
And it's a city that sits on the ground very lightly. 
It sits on the banks of these rivers. 
And it leaves very little mark. 
There are no foundations; fabric is used to build this entire city. 
What's also quite incredible is that there are five materials that are used to build this settlement for seven million people: eight-foot tall bamboo, string or rope, nails or screw and a skinning material. 
Could be corrugated metal, a fabric or plastic. 
And these materials come together and aggregate. 
It's like a kit of parts. 
And it's used all the way from a small tent, which might house five or six people, or a family, to temples that can house 500, sometimes 1,000 people. 
And this kit of parts, and this imagination of the city, allows it to be disassembled. 
And so at the end of the festival, within a week, the entire city is disassembled. 
These are again images from the same spot. 
And the terrain is offered back to the river, as with the monsoon the water swells again. 
And it's this sort of imagination as a kit of parts that allows this disassembly and the reabsorption of all this material. 
So the electricity poles go to little villages in the hinterland, the pontoon bridges are used in small towns, the material is all reabsorbed. 
Fascinating, it's amazing. 
Now, you may embrace these Hindu beliefs or not. 
But you know, this is a stunning example, and it's worthy of reflection. 
Here, human beings spend an enormous amount of energy and imagination knowing that the city is going to reverse, it's going to be disassembled, it's going to disappear, it's the ephemeral megacity. 
And it has profound lessons to teach us. 
Lessons about how to touch the ground lightly, about reversibility, about disassembly. 
Rather amazing. 
And you know, we are, as humans, obsessed with permanence. 
We resist change. 
It's an impulse that we all have. 
And we resist change in spite of the fact that change is perhaps the only constant in our lives. 
Everything has an expiry date, including Spaceship Earth, our planet. 
So what can we learn from these sorts of settlements? 
Burning Man, of course much smaller, but reversible. 
Or the thousands of markets for transaction, that appear around the globe in Asia, Latin America, Africa, this one in Mexico, where the parking lots are animated on the weekends, about 50,000 vendors, but on a temporal cycle. 
The farmer's market in the Americas: it's an amazing phenomenon, creates new chemistries, extends the margin of space that is unused or not used optimally, like parking lots, for example. 
In my own city of Mumbai, where I practice as an architect and a planner, I see this in the everyday landscape. 
I call this the Kinetic City. 
It twitches like a live organism; it's not static. 
It changes every day, on sometimes predictable cycles. 
About six million people live in these kinds of temporary settlements. 
Like -- unfortunately, like refugee camps, the slums of Mumbai, the favelas of Latin America. 
Here, the temporary is becoming the new permanent. 
Here, urbanism is not about grand vision, it's about grand adjustment. 
On the street in Mumbai, during the Ganesh festival, a transformation. 
A community hall is created for 10 days. 
Bollywood films are shown, thousands congregate for dinners and celebration. 
It's made out of paper-mache and plaster of Paris. 
Designed to be disassembled, and in 10 days, overnight, it disappears, and the street goes back to anonymity. 
Or our wonderful open spaces, we call them maidans. 
And it's used for this incredibly nuanced and complicated, fascinating Indian game, called cricket, which, I believe, the British invented. 
(Laughter) And in the evenings, a wedding wraps around the cricket pitch -- Notice, the cricket pitch is not touched, it's sacred ground. 
(Laughter) But here, the club members and the wedding party partake in tea through a common kitchen. 
And at midnight, it's disassembled, and the space offered back to the city. 
Here, urbanism is an elastic condition. 
And so, if we reflect about these questions, I mean, I think many come to mind. 
But an important one is, are we really, in our cities, in our imagination about urbanism, making permanent solutions for temporary problems? 
Are we locking resources into paradigms that we don't even know will be relevant in a decade? 
This becomes, I think, an interesting question that arises from this research. 
I mean, look at the abandoned shopping malls in North America, suburban North America. 
Retail experts have predicted that in the next decade, of the 2,000 malls that exist today, 50 percent will be abandoned. 
Massive amount of material, capturing resources, that will not be relevant soon. 
Or the Olympic stadiums. 
Around the globe, cities build these under great contestation with massive resources, but after the games go, they can't often get absorbed into the city. 
Couldn't these be nomadic structures, deflatable, we have the technology for that, that get gifted to smaller towns around the world or in those countries, or are stored and moved for the next Olympics? 
A massive, inefficient use of resources. 
Like the circus. 
I mean, we could imagine it like the circus, this wonderful institution that used to camp in cities, set up this lovely kind of visual dialogue with the static city. 
And within it, the amazement. 
Children of different ethnic groups become suddenly aware of each other, people of color become aware of others, income groups and cultures and ethnicities all come together around the amazement of the ring with animals and performers. 
New chemistries are created, people become aware of things, and this moves on to the next town. 
Or nature, the fluxes of nature, climate change, how do we deal with this, can we be more accommodating? 
Can we create softer urban systems? 
Or are we going to challenge nature continuously with heavy infrastructure, which we are already doing, unsuccessfully? 
Now, I'm not arguing that we've got to make our cities like a circus, I'm not arguing that cities must be completely temporary. 
I'm only making a plea that we need to make a shift in our imagination about cities, where we need to reserve more space for uses on a temporal scale. 
Where we need to use our resources efficiently, to extend the expiry date of our planet. 
We need to change planning urban design cultures, to think of the temporal, the reversible, the disassembleable. 
And that can be tremendous in terms of the effect it might have on our lives. 
I often think back to the Kumbh Mela that I visited with my students and I studied, and this was a moment where the city had been disassembled. 
A week after the festival was over. 
There was no mark. 
The terrain was waiting to be covered over by the water, to be consumed. 
And I went to thank a high priestess who had helped us and my students through our research and facilitated us through this process. 
And I went to her with great enthusiasm, and I told her about how much we had learned about infrastructure, the city, the efficiency of the city, the architecture, the five materials that made the city. 
She looked really amused, she was smiling. 
In any case, she leaned forward and put her hand on my head to bless me. 
And she whispered in my ear, she said, "Feel blessed that the Mother Ganges allowed you all to sit in her lap for a few days." 
I've often thought about this, and of course, I understood what she said. 
She said, cities, people, architecture will come and go, but the planet is here to stay. 
Touch it lightly, leave a minimal mark. 
And I think that's an important lesson for us as citizens and architects. 
And I think it was this experience that made me believe that impermanence is bigger than permanence and bigger than us all. 
Thank you for listening. 
(Applause) 

I've been a police officer in an urban city for nearly 25 years. 
That's crazy, right? 
And in that time, I've served in every rank, from police officer to police chief. 
A few years ago, I noticed something alarming. 
Starting in 2014, I started monitoring recruits as they cycled through police academies in the state of New Jersey, and I found that women were failing at rates between 65 and 80 percent, due to varying aspects of the physical fitness test. 
I learned that a change in policy now required recruits to pass the fitness exam within 10 short workout sessions. 
This had the greatest impact on women. 
The change meant that recruits had about three weeks out of a five-month-long academy to pass the fitness exam. 
This just didn't make sense, though. 
Police agencies and police recruits had made huge investments to get those recruits into the academy. 
Police recruits had passed lengthy background checks, they had passed medical and psychological exams, they had quit their jobs. 
And many had spent more than 2,000 dollars in fees and equipment just to get kicked out within the first three weeks? 
The dire situation in New Jersey led me to examine the status of women in policing across the United States. 
I found that women make up less than 13 percent of police officers. 
A number that hasn't changed much in the past 20 years. 
And they make up just three percent of police chiefs as of 2013, the last time the data was collected. 
We know that we can improve those rates. 
Other countries like Canada, Australia and the UK have nearly twice the amount of policewomen. 
And New Zealand is steadily marching towards their goal of recruit gender parity by 2021. 
Other countries are actively working to increase the number of women in policing, because they know of a vast body of research evidence, spanning more than 50 years, detailing the advantages to women in policing. 
From that research, we know that policewomen are less likely to use force or to be accused of excessive force. 
We know that policewomen are less likely to be named in a lawsuit or a citizen complaint. 
We know that the mere presence of a policewoman reduces the use of force among other officers. 
And we know that policewomen are met with the same rates of force as their male counterparts, and sometimes more, and yet they're more successful in defusing violent or aggressive behavior overall. 
So there are vast advantages to women in policing, and we're losing them to arbitrary fitness standards. 
The problem is, the United States has nearly 18,000 police agencies -- 18,000 agencies with wildly varying fitness standards. 
We know that a majority of academies rely on a masculine ideal of policing that works to decrease the number of women in policing. 
These types of academies overemphasize physical strength, with much less attention spent to subjects like community policing, problem-solving and interpersonal communication skills. 
This results in training that does not mirror the realities of policing. 
Physical agility is but a small component of police work. 
Much of an officer's day is spent mediating interpersonal conflicts. 
That's the reality of policing. 
These are my babies. 
And we can reduce the disparity in policing by changing exams that produce disparate outcomes. 
The federal courts have stated that men and women simply are not physiologically the same for the purposes of physical fitness programs. 
And that's based on science. 
Respected institutions that law enforcement deeply respects, like the FBI, the US Marshals Service, the DEA and even the US military -- they rigorously test fitness programs to ensure they measure fitness without gender-disparate outcomes. 
Why is that? 
Because recruiting is expensive. 
They want to recruit and retain qualified candidates. 
You know what else the research finds? 
Well-trained women are as capable as their male counterparts in overall fitness, but more importantly, in how they police. 
The law-enforcement community is admittedly experiencing a recruitment crisis. 
Yet, if they truly want to increase the number of applicants, they can. 
We can easily recruit more women and reap all those research benefits by training well-qualified candidates to pass validated, work-related, physiologically-based fitness exams, as required by Title VII of the Civil Rights Act. 
We can increase the number of women, we can reduce that gender disparity, by simply changing exams that produce disparate outcomes. 
We have the tools. 
We have the research, we have the science, we have the law. 
This, my friends, should be a very easy fix. 
Thank you. 
(Applause) 

Today, actually, is a very special day for me, because it is my birthday. 
(Applause) And so, thanks to all of you for joining the party. 
(Laughter) But every time you throw a party, there's someone there to spoil it. Right? 
(Laughter) And I'm a physicist, and this time I brought another physicist along to do so. 
His name is Albert Einstein -- also Albert -- and he's the one who said that the person who has not made his great contributions to science by the age of 30 will never do so. 
(Laughter) Now, you don't need to check Wikipedia that I'm beyond 30. 
(Laughter) So, effectively, what he is telling me, and us, is that when it comes to my science, I'm deadwood. 
Well, luckily, I had my share of luck within my career. 
Around age 28, I became very interested in networks, and a few years later, we managed to publish a few key papers that reported the discovery of scale-free networks and really gave birth to a new discipline that we call network science today. 
And if you really care about it, you can get a PhD now in network science in Budapest, in Boston, and you can study it all over the world. 
A few years later, when I moved to Harvard first as a sabbatical, I became interested in another type of network: that time, the networks within ourselves, how the genes and the proteins and the metabolites link to each other and how they connect to disease. 
And that interest led to a major explosion within medicine, including the Network Medicine Division at Harvard, that has more than 300 researchers who are using this perspective to treat patients and develop new cures. 
And a few years ago, I thought that I would take this idea of networks and the expertise we had in networks in a different area, that is, to understand success. 
And why did we do that? 
Well, we thought that, to some degree, our success is determined by the networks we're part of -- that our networks can push us forward, they can pull us back. 
And I was curious if we could use the knowledge and big data and expertise where we develop the networks to really quantify how these things happen. 
This is a result from that. 
What you see here is a network of galleries in museums that connect to each other. 
And through this map that we mapped out last year, we are able to predict very accurately the success of an artist if you give me the first five exhibits that he or she had in their career. 
Well, as we thought about success, we realized that success is not only about networks; there are so many other dimensions to that. 
And one of the things we need for success, obviously, is performance. 
So let's define what's the difference between performance and success. 
Well, performance is what you do: how fast you run, what kind of paintings you paint, what kind of papers you publish. 
However, in our working definition, success is about what the community notices from what you did, from your performance: How does it acknowledge it, and how does it reward you for it? 
In other terms, your performance is about you, but your success is about all of us. 
And this was a very important shift for us, because the moment we defined success as being a collective measure that the community provides to us, it became measurable, because if it's in the community, there are multiple data points about that. 
So we go to school, we exercise, we practice, because we believe that performance leads to success. 
But the way we actually started to explore, we realized that performance and success are very, very different animals when it comes to the mathematics of the problem. 
And let me illustrate that. 
So what you see here is the fastest man on earth, Usain Bolt. 
And of course, he wins most of the competitions that he enters. 
And we know he's the fastest on earth because we have a chronometer to measure his speed. 
Well, what is interesting about him is that when he wins, he doesn't do so by really significantly outrunning his competition. 
He's running at most a percent faster than the one who loses the race. 
And not only does he run only one percent faster than the second one, but he doesn't run 10 times faster than I do -- and I'm not a good runner, trust me on that. 
(Laughter) And every time we are able to measure performance, we notice something very interesting; that is, performance is bounded. 
What it means is that there are no huge variations in human performance. 
It varies only in a narrow range, and we do need the chronometer to measure the differences. 
This is not to say that we cannot see the good from the best ones, but the best ones are very hard to distinguish. 
And the problem with that is that most of us work in areas where we do not have a chronometer to gauge our performance. 
Alright, performance is bounded, there are no huge differences between us when it comes to our performance. 
How about success? 
Well, let's switch to a different topic, like books. 
One measure of success for writers is how many people read your work. 
And so when my previous book came out in 2009, I was in Europe talking with my editor, and I was interested: Who is the competition? 
And I had some fabulous ones. 
That week -- (Laughter) Dan Brown came out with "The Lost Symbol," and "The Last Song" also came out, Nicholas Sparks. 
And when you just look at the list, you realize, you know, performance-wise, there's hardly any difference between these books or mine. 
Right? 
So maybe if Nicholas Sparks's team works a little harder, he could easily be number one, because it's almost by accident who ended up at the top. 
So I said, let's look at the numbers -- I'm a data person, right? 
So let's see what were the sales for Nicholas Sparks. 
And it turns out that that opening weekend, Nicholas Sparks sold more than a hundred thousand copies, which is an amazing number. 
You can actually get to the top of the "New York Times" best-seller list by selling 10,000 copies a week, so he tenfold overcame what he needed to be number one. 
Yet he wasn't number one. 
Why? 
Because there was Dan Brown, who sold 1.2 million copies that weekend. 
(Laughter) And the reason I like this number is because it shows that, really, when it comes to success, it's unbounded, that the best doesn't only get slightly more than the second best but gets orders of magnitude more, because success is a collective measure. 
We give it to them, rather than we earn it through our performance. 
So one of things we realized is that performance, what we do, is bounded, but success, which is collective, is unbounded, which makes you wonder: How do you get these huge differences in success when you have such tiny differences in performance? 
And recently, I published a book that I devoted to that very question. 
And they didn't give me enough time to go over all of that, so I'm going to go back to the question of, alright, you have success; when should that appear? 
So let's go back to the party spoiler and ask ourselves: Why did Einstein make this ridiculous statement, that only before 30 you could actually be creative? 
Well, because he looked around himself and he saw all these fabulous physicists that created quantum mechanics and modern physics, and they were all in their 20s and early 30s when they did so. 
And it's not only him. 
It's not only observational bias, because there's actually a whole field of genius research that has documented the fact that, if we look at the people we admire from the past and then look at what age they made their biggest contribution, whether that's music, whether that's science, whether that's engineering, most of them tend to do so in their 20s, 30s, early 40s at most. 
But there's a problem with this genius research. 
Well, first of all, it created the impression to us that creativity equals youth, which is painful, right? 
(Laughter) And it also has an observational bias, because it only looks at geniuses and doesn't look at ordinary scientists and doesn't look at all of us and ask, is it really true that creativity vanishes as we age? 
So that's exactly what we tried to do, and this is important for that to actually have references. 
So let's look at an ordinary scientist like myself, and let's look at my career. 
So what you see here is all the papers that I've published from my very first paper, in 1989; I was still in Romania when I did so, till kind of this year. 
And vertically, you see the impact of the paper, that is, how many citations, how many other papers have been written that cited that work. 
And when you look at that, you see that my career has roughly three different stages. 
I had the first 10 years where I had to work a lot and I don't achieve much. 
No one seems to care about what I do, right? 
There's hardly any impact. 
(Laughter) That time, I was doing material science, and then I kind of discovered for myself networks and then started publishing in networks. 
And that led from one high-impact paper to the other one. 
And it really felt good. That was that stage of my career. 
(Laughter) So the question is, what happens right now? 
And we don't know, because there hasn't been enough time passed yet to actually figure out how much impact those papers will get; it takes time to acquire. 
Well, when you look at the data, it seems to be that Einstein, the genius research, is right, and I'm at that stage of my career. 
(Laughter) So we said, OK, let's figure out how does this really happen, first in science. 
And in order not to have the selection bias, to look only at geniuses, we ended up reconstructing the career of every single scientist from 1900 till today and finding for all scientists what was their personal best, whether they got the Nobel Prize or they never did, or no one knows what they did, even their personal best. 
And that's what you see in this slide. 
Each line is a career, and when you have a light blue dot on the top of that career, it says that was their personal best. 
And the question is, when did they actually make their biggest discovery? 
To quantify that, we look at what's the probability that you make your biggest discovery, let's say, one, two, three or 10 years into your career? 
We're not looking at real age. 
We're looking at what we call "academic age." 
I know some of you are still babies. 
(Laughter) So let's look at the probability that you publish your highest-impact paper. 
And what you see is, indeed, the genius research is right. 
Most scientists tend to publish their highest-impact paper in the first 10, 15 years in their career, and it tanks after that. 
It tanks so fast that I'm about -- I'm exactly 30 years into my career, and the chance that I will publish a paper that would have a higher impact than anything that I did before is less than one percent. 
I am in that stage of my career, according to this data. 
But there's a problem with that. 
We're not doing controls properly. 
So the control would be, what would a scientist look like who makes random contribution to science? 
Or what is the productivity of the scientist? 
When do they write papers? 
So we measured the productivity, and amazingly, the productivity, your likelihood of writing a paper in year one, 10 or 20 in your career, is indistinguishable from the likelihood of having the impact in that part of your career. 
And to make a long story short, after lots of statistical tests, there's only one explanation for that, that really, the way we scientists work is that every single paper we write, every project we do, has exactly the same chance of being our personal best. 
That is, discovery is like a lottery ticket. 
And the more lottery tickets we buy, the higher our chances. 
And it happens to be so that most scientists buy most of their lottery tickets in the first 10, 15 years of their career, and after that, their productivity decreases. 
They're not buying any more lottery tickets. 
So it looks as if they would not be creative. 
In reality, they stopped trying. 
So when we actually put the data together, the conclusion is very simple: success can come at any time. 
It could be your very first or very last paper of your career. 
It's totally random in the space of the projects. 
It is the productivity that changes. 
Let me illustrate that. 
Here is Frank Wilczek, who got the Nobel Prize in Physics for the very first paper he ever wrote in his career as a graduate student. 
(Laughter) More interesting is John Fenn, who, at age 70, was forcefully retired by Yale University. 
They shut his lab down, and at that moment, he moved to Virginia Commonwealth University, opened another lab, and it is there, at age 72, that he published a paper for which, 15 years later, he got the Nobel Prize for Chemistry. 
And you think, OK, well, science is special, but what about other areas where we need to be creative? 
So let me take another typical example: entrepreneurship. 
Silicon Valley, the land of the youth, right? 
And indeed, when you look at it, you realize that the biggest awards, the TechCrunch Awards and other awards, are all going to people whose average age is late 20s, very early 30s. 
You look at who the VCs give the money to, some of the biggest VC firms -- all people in their early 30s. 
Which, of course, we know; there is this ethos in Silicon Valley that youth equals success. 
Not when you look at the data, because it's not only about forming a company -- forming a company is like productivity, trying, trying, trying -- when you look at which of these individuals actually put out a successful company, a successful exit. 
And recently, some of our colleagues looked at exactly that question. 
And it turns out that yes, those in the 20s and 30s put out a huge number of companies, form lots of companies, but most of them go bust. 
And when you look at the successful exits, what you see in this particular plot, the older you are, the more likely that you will actually hit the stock market or the sell the company successfully. 
This is so strong, actually, that if you are in the 50s, you are twice as likely to actually have a successful exit than if you are in your 30s. 
(Applause) So in the end, what is it that we see, actually? 
What we see is that creativity has no age. 
Productivity does, right? 
Which is telling me that at the end of the day, if you keep trying -- (Laughter) you could still succeed and succeed over and over. 
So my conclusion is very simple: I am off the stage, back in my lab. 
Thank you. 
(Applause) 

I'm an historian. 
And what I love about being an historian is it gives you perspective. 
Today, I'd like to bring that perspective to education in the United States. 
About the only thing people can agree on is that the most strategic time for a child to start learning is early. 
Over 50 years ago, there was a watershed moment in early education in the US called "Head Start." 
Now, historians love watersheds because it makes it so easy to talk about what came before and what's happened since. 
Before Head Start, basically nothing. 
With Head Start, we began to get our nation's most at-risk children ready for school. 
Since Head Start, we've made strides, but there are still 2.2 million children in the US without access to early learning, or more than half of the four-year-olds in the country. 
That's a problem. 
But the bigger problem is what we know happens to those children. 
At-risk children who reach school without basic skills are 25 percent more likely to drop out, 40 percent more likely to become teen parents and 60 percent less likely to go to college. 
So if we know how important early education is, why aren't all children getting it? 
There are barriers that the solutions we've come up with to date simply can't overcome. 
Geography: think rural and remote. 
Transportation: think working parents everywhere. 
Parent choice: no state requires a four-year-old to go to school. 
And cost: the average cost for a state to educate a preschooler is five thousand dollars a year. 
So am I just going to keep talking about problems? 
No. 
Today, I want to tell you about a cost-effective, technology-delivered, kindergarten-readiness program that can be done in the home. 
It's called UPSTART, and more than 60,000 preschoolers in the US have already used it. 
Now, I know what you might be thinking: here's another person throwing tech at a national problem. 
And you'd be partially right. 
We develop early learning software designed to individualize instruction, so children can learn at their own pace. 
To do that, we rely on experts from fields ranging from reading to sociology to brain science development to all aspects of early learning, to tell us what the software should do and look like. 
Here's an example. 
(Video) Zero (sings to the tune of "Day-O"): Zero! 
Zero! 
Zero is the number that's different from the others. 
Seagulls: Zero is a big, round "O." 
Zero: It's not like one, I'm sure you'll discover. 
Seagulls: Zero is a big, round "O." 
(Laughter) Claudia Miner: That is "The Zero Song." 
(Laughter) And here are Odd Todd and Even Steven to teach you some things about numbers. 
And here are the Word Birds, and they're going to show you when you blend letter sounds together, you can form words. 
You can see that instruction is short, colorful and catchy, designed to capture a child's attention. 
But there's another piece to UPSTART that makes it different and more effective. 
UPSTART puts parents in charge of their children's education. 
We believe, with the right support, all parents can get their children ready for school. 
Here's how it works. 
This is the kindergarten readiness checklist from a state. 
And almost every state has one. 
We go to parents wherever they are, and we conduct a key in-person group training. 
And we tell them the software can check every reading, math and science box, but they're going to be responsible for motor skills and self-help skills, and together, we're going to work on social emotional learning. 
Now, we know this is working because we have a 90-percent completion rate for the program. 
Last year, that translated into 13,500 children "graduating," with diplomas, from UPSTART. 
And the results have been amazing. 
We have an external evaluation that shows our children have two to three times the learning gains as children who don't participate in the program. 
We have a random control trial that shows strong evidence of effectiveness, and we even have a longitudinal study that shows our children's gains last into third and fourth grade, the highest grades the children had achieved at the time. 
Those are academic gains. 
But another study has shown that our children's social emotional gains are equal to those of children attending public and private preschool. 
The majority of the 60,000 children who have participated in UPSTART to date have been from Utah. 
But we have replicated our results with African-American children in Mississippi -- this is Kingston and his mother; with English language learners in Arizona -- this is Daisy and her family; with refugee children in Philadelphia -- this is my favorite graduation photo; and with Native American children from some of the most remote parts of the United States. 
This is Cherise, and this is where she lives in Monument Valley. 
Now, there are skeptics about UPSTART. 
Some people don't believe young children should have screen time. 
To them, we say: UPSTART's usage requirement of 15 minutes a day, five days a week, is well within the hour-a-day recommended by the American Academy of Pediatrics for four-year-olds. 
Some people believe only site-based preschool can work, and to them, we say: site-based preschool is great, but if you can't get a child there or if a parent won't send a child there, isn't a technology-delivered, results-based option a great alternative? 
And we love working with site-based preschools. 
Right now, there are 800 children in Mississippi going to Head Start during the day and doing UPSTART at night with their families. 
Our audacious idea is to take UPSTART across the country -- not to replace anything; we want to serve children who otherwise would not have access to early education. 
We have the guts to take on the skeptics, we have the energy to do the work, and we have a plan. 
It is the role of the states to educate their children. 
So first we will use philanthropy dollars to go into a state to pilot the program and get data. 
Every state believes it's unique and wants to know that the program will work with its children before investing. 
Then we identify key leaders in the state to help us champion UPSTART as an option for unserved children. 
And together, we go to state legislatures to transition UPSTART from philanthropy to sustainable and scalable state funding. 
That plan has worked -- (Applause) Thanks. 
Thank you. 
That plan has worked in three states to date: Utah, Indiana and South Carolina. 
We've also piloted the program in a number of states and identified champions. 
Next, we're moving to states with the greatest geographic barriers to work the plan, and then on to states that already have early education but may not be getting great academic results or great parent buy-in to participate. 
From there, we go to the states that are going to require the most data and work to convince, and we'll hope our momentum helps turn the tide there. 
We will serve a quarter of a million children in five years, and we will ensure that states continue to offer UPSTART to their children. 
Here's how you can help: for two thousand dollars, we can provide a child with UPSTART, a computer and internet, and that child will be part of the pilot that makes certain other children get UPSTART in the future. 
We also need engaged citizens to go to their government and say just how easy it can be to get children ready for school. 
You wouldn't be here if you weren't an engaged citizen, so we're asking for your help. 
Now, will all of us this make UPSTART a watershed moment in early education? 
I believe together we can make it one. 
But I can tell you without a doubt that UPSTART is a watershed moment in the life of a child who otherwise would not be ready for school. 
Thank you. 
(Applause) 

So I've got something that I'm slightly embarrassed to admit to. 
At the age of 17, as a creationist, I decided to go to university to study evolution so that I could destroy it. 
(Laughter) I failed. 
I failed so spectacularly that I'm now an evolutionary biologist. 
(Applause) So I'm a paleoanthropologist, I'm a National Geographic Explorer specializing in fossil hunting in caves in unstable, hostile and disputed territories. 
And we all know that if I was a guy and not a girl, that wouldn't be a job description, that would be a pick-up line. 
(Laughter) Now, here's the thing. I do not have a death wish. 
I'm not an adrenaline junkie. 
I just looked at a map. 
See, frontline exploratory science does not happen as much in politically unstable territories. 
This is a map of all the places which the British Foreign Office have declared contain red zones, orange zones or have raised some kind of a threat warning about. 
Now I'm going to go out on a limb here and say that it is a tragedy if we're not doing frontline exploratory science in a huge portion of the planet. 
And so science has a geography problem. 
Also, as a paleoanthropologist, guys, this is basically a map of some of the most important places in the human journey. 
There are almost definitely fascinating fossils to be found here. 
But are we looking for them? 
And so as an undergraduate, I was repeatedly told that humans, be they ourselves, homo sapiens, or earlier species, that we left Africa via the Sinai of Egypt. 
I'm English, as you can probably tell from my accent, but I am actually of Arab heritage, and I always say that I'm very, very Arab on the outside. 
You know, I can really be passionate. 
Like, "You're amazing! I love you!" 
But on the inside, I'm really English, so everybody irritates me. 
(Laughter) It's true. 
And the thing is, my family are Arab from Yemen, and I knew that that channel, Bab-el-Mandeb, is not that much of a feat to cross. 
And I kept asking myself this really simple question: if the ancestors to New World monkeys could somehow cross the Atlantic Ocean, why couldn't humans cross that tiny stretch of water? 
But the thing is, Yemen, compared to, let's say, Europe, was so understudied that it was something akin to near virgin territory. 
But that, along with its location, made the sheer potential for discovery so exciting, and I had so many questions. 
When did we first start using Bab-el-Mandeb? 
But also, which species of human besides ourselves made it to Yemen? 
Might we find a species as yet unknown to science? 
And it turned out, I wasn't the only one who had noticed Yemen's potential. 
There was actually a few other academics out there. 
But sadly, due to political instability, they moved out, and so I moved in. 
And I was looking for caves: caves because caves are the original prime real estate. 
But also because if you're looking for fossils in that kind of heat, your best bet for fossil preservation is always going to be caves. 
But then, Yemen took a really sad turn for the worse, and just a few days before I was due to fly out to Yemen, the civil war escalated into a regional conflict, the capital's airport was bombed and Yemen became a no-fly zone. 
Now, my parents made this decision before I was born: that I would be born British. 
I had nothing to do with the best decision of my life. 
And now ... 
Now the lucky ones in my family have escaped, and the others, the others are being been bombed and send you WhatsApp messages that make you detest your very existence. 
This war's been going on for four years. 
It's been going on for over four years, and it has led to a humanitarian crisis. 
There is a famine there, a man-made famine. 
That's a man-made famine, so not a natural famine, an entirely man-made famine that the UN has warned could be the worst famine the world has seen in a hundred years. 
This war has made it clear to me more than ever that no place, no people deserve to get left behind. 
And so I was joining these other teams, and I was forming new collaborations in other unstable places. 
But I was desperate to get back into Yemen, because for me, Yemen's really personal. 
And so I kept trying to think of a project I could do in Yemen that would help highlight what was going on there. 
And every idea I had just kept failing, or it was just too high-risk, because let's be honest, most of Yemen is just too dangerous for a Western team. 
But then I was told that Socotra, a Yemeni island, was safe once you got there. 
In fact, it turned out there was a few local and international academics that were still working there. 
And that got me really excited, because look at Socotra's proximity to Africa. 
And yet we have no idea when humans arrived on that island. 
But Socotra, for those of you who know it, well, let's just say you probably know it for a completely different reason. 
You probably know it as the Galapagos of the Indian Ocean, because it is one of the most biodiverse places on this earth. 
But we were also getting information that this incredibly delicate environment and its people were under threat because they were at the frontline of both Middle Eastern politics and climate change. 
And it slowly dawned on me that Socotra was my Yemen project. 
And so I wanted to put together a huge multidisciplinary team. 
We wanted to cross the archipelago on foot, camel and dhow boat to conduct a health check of this place. 
This has only been attempted once before, and it was in 1999. 
But the thing is, that is not an easy thing to pull off. 
And so we desperately needed a recce, and for those of you who aren't familiar with British English, a recce is like a scouting expedition. 
It's like a reconnaissance. 
And I often say that a really big expedition without a recce is a bit like a first date without a Facebook stalk. 
(Laughter) Like, it's doable, but is it wise? 
(Laughter) There's a few too many knowing laughs in this room. 
Anyway, so then our recce team thankfully were no strangers to unstable places, which, let's be honest, is kind of important because we were trying to get to a place between Yemen and Somalia, And after calling in what felt like a million favors, including to the deputy governor, we finally found ourselves on the move, albeit on a wooden cement cargo ship sailing through pirate waters in the Indian Ocean with this as a toilet. 
(Laughter) Can you guys see this? 
You know how everybody has their worst toilet story? 
Well, I've never swam with dolphins before. 
I just went straight to pooping on them. 
(Laughter) And also, I genuinely discovered that I am genuinely less stressed by pirate waters than I am with a cockroach infestation that was so intense that at one point I went belowdeck, and the floor was black and it was moving. 
(Audience moans) Yeah, and at night there was three raised platforms to sleep on, but there was only -- let's say there was four team members, and the thing is, if you got a raised platform to sleep on, you only had to contend with a few cockroaches during the night, whereas if you got the floor, good luck to you. 
And so I was the only girl in the team and the whole ship, so I got away without sleeping on the floor. 
And then, on, like, the fourth or fifth night, Martin Edström looks at me and goes, "Ella, Ella I really believe in equality." 
(Laughter) So we were sailing on that cement cargo ship for three days, and then we slowly started seeing land. 
And after three years of failing, I was finally seeing Yemen. 
And there is no feeling on earth like that start of an expedition. 
It's this moment where you jump out of a jeep or you look up from a boat and you know that there's this possibility, it's small but it's still there, that you're about to find something that could add to or change our knowledge of who we are and where we come from. 
There is no feeling like it on earth, and it's a feeling that so many scientists have but rarely in politically unstable places. 
Because Western scientists are discouraged or all-out barred from working in unstable places. 
But here's the thing: scientists specialize in the jungle. 
Scientists work in deep cave systems. 
Scientists attach themselves to rockets and blow themselves into outer space. 
But apparently, working in an unstable place is deemed too high-risk. 
It is completely arbitrary. 
Who here in this room wasn't brought up on adventure stories? 
And most of our heroes were actually scientists and academics. 
Science was about going out into the unknown. 
It was about truly global exploration, even if there were risks. 
And so when did it become acceptable to make it difficult for science to happen in unstable places? 
And look, I'm not saying that all scientists should go off and start working in unstable places. 
This isn't some gung-ho call. 
But here's the thing: for those who have done the research, understand security protocol and are trained, stop stopping those who want to. 
Plus, just because one part of a country is an active war zone doesn't mean the whole country is. 
I'm not saying we should go into active war zones. 
But Iraqi Kurdistan looks very different from Fallujah. 
And actually, a few months after I couldn't get into Yemen, another team adopted me. 
So Professor Graeme Barker's team were actually working in Iraqi Kurdistan, and they were digging up Shanidar Cave. 
Now, Shanidar Cave a few decades earlier had unveiled a Neanderthal known as Shanidar 1. 
Now, for a BBC/PBS TV series we actually brought Shanidar 1 to life, and I want you guys to meet Ned, Ned the Neanderthal. 
Now here's the coolest thing about Ned. 
Ned, this guy, you're meeting him before his injuries. 
See, it turned out that Ned was severely disabled. 
He was in fact so disabled that there is no way he could have survived without the help of other Neanderthals. 
And so this was proof that, at least for this population of Neanderthals at this time, Neanderthals were like us, and they sometimes looked after those who couldn't look after themselves. 
Ned's an Iraqi Neanderthal. 
So what else are we missing? 
What incredible scientific discoveries are we not making because we're not looking? 
And by the way, these places, they deserve narratives of hope, and science and exploration can be a part of that. 
In fact, I would argue that it can tangibly aid development, and these discoveries become a huge source of local pride. 
And that brings me to the second reason why science has a geography problem. 
See, we don't empower local academics, do we? 
Like, it's not lost on me that in my particular field of paleoanthropology we study human origins, but we have so few diverse scientists. 
And the thing is, these places are full of students and academics who are desperate to collaborate, and the truth is that for them, they have fewer security issues than us. 
I think we constantly forget that for them it's not a hostile environment; for them it's home. 
I'm telling you, research done in unstable places with local collaborators can lead to incredible discoveries, and that is what we are hoping upon hope to do in Socotra. 
They call Socotra the most alien-looking place on earth, and myself, Leon McCarron, Martin Edström and Rhys Thwaites-Jones could see why. 
I mean, look at this place. 
These places, they're not hellholes, they're not write-offs, they're the future frontline of science and exploration. 
90 percent of the reptiles on this island, 37 percent of the plant species exist here and nowhere else on earth, and that includes this species of dragon's blood tree, which actually bleeds this red resin. 
And there's something else. 
People on Socotra, some of them still live in caves, and that is really exciting, because it means if a cave is prime real estate this century, maybe it was a few thousand years ago. 
But we need the data to prove it, the fossils, the stone tools, and so our scouting team have teamed up with other scientists, anthropologists and storytellers, international as well as local, like Ahmed Alarqbi, and we are desperate to shed a light on this place before it's too late. 
And now, now we just somehow need to get back for that really big expedition, because science, science has a geography problem. 
You guys have been a really lovely audience. 
Thank you. 
(Applause) 

I'd like you to take a moment and consider what you are wearing right now. 
I have a deep, philosophical question for you. 
Why are we not all wearing comfortable pajamas right now? 
(Laughter) Well, I'm a psychologist and not a mind reader, although many people think that's the same thing. 
I can bet you that your response is somewhere along the lines of, "I'm expected to not wear pj's in public" or "I don't want people to think I am a slob." 
Either way, the fact that we all chose to wear business casual clothing, as opposed to our favorite pair of sweatpants, is not a silly coincidence. 
Instead, it reveals two defining human characteristics. 
The first is that we are cognizant of what other people value, like what they will approve or disapprove of, such as not wearing pj's to these sorts of settings. 
And two, we've readily used this information to guide our behavior. 
Unlike many other species, humans are prone to tailor their behavior in the presence of others to garner approval. 
We spend valuable time putting on make up, choosing the right picture and Instagram filter, and composing ideas that will undoubtedly change the world in 140 characters or less. 
Clearly, our concern with how other people will evaluate us is a big part of being human. 
Despite this being a big human trait, however, we know relatively little about when and how we come to care about the opinion of others. 
Now, this is a big question that requires many studies. 
But the first step to uncovering this question is to investigate when in development we become sensitive to others' evaluations. 
I have spent the past four years at Emory University investigating how an infant, who has no problem walking around the grocery store in her onesie, develops into an adult that fears public speaking for fear of being negatively judged. 
(Laughter) Now, this is usually a point when people ask me, "How do you investigate this question, exactly? 
Infants can't talk, right?" 
Well, if my husband were up here right now, he would tell you that I interview babies, because he would rather not say that his wife experiments on children. 
(Laughter) In reality, I design experiments for children, usually in the form of games. 
Developmental psychologist Dr. Philippe Rochat and I designed a "game" called "The Robot Task" to explore when children would begin to be sensitive to the evaluation of others. 
Specifically, the robot task captures when children, like adults, strategically modify their behavior when others are watching. 
To do this, we showed 14 to 24-month-old infants how to activate a toy robot, and importantly, we either assigned a positive value, saying "Wow, isn't that great!" 
or a negative value, saying, "Oh, oh. Oops, oh no," after pressing the remote. 
Following this toy demonstration, we invited the infants to play with the remote, and then either watched them or turned around and pretended to read a magazine. 
The idea was that if by 24 months, children are indeed sensitive to the evaluation of others, then their button-pressing behavior should be influenced not only by whether or not they're being watched but also by the values that the experimenter expressed towards pressing the remote. 
So for example, we would expect children to play with the positive remote significantly more if they were being observed but then choose to explore the negative remote once no one was watching. 
To really capture this phenomenon, we did three variations of the study. 
Study one explored how infants would engage with a novel toy if there were no values or instructions provided. 
So we simply showed infants how to activate the toy robot, but didn't assign any values, and we also didn't tell them that they could play with the remote, providing them with a really ambiguous situation. 
In study two, we incorporated the two values, a positive and a negative. 
And in the last study, we had two experimenters and one remote. 
One experimenter expressed a negative value towards pressing the remote, saying, "Yuck, the toy moved," while the other experimenter expressed a positive value, saying, "Yay, the toy moved." 
And this is how the children reacted to these three different scenarios. 
So in study one, the ambiguous situation, I'm currently watching the child. 
She doesn't seem to be too interested in pressing the remote. 
Once I turned around -- now she's ready to play. 
(Laughter) Currently, I'm not watching the child. 
She's really focused. 
I turn around. 
(Laughter) She wasn't doing anything, right? 
In study two, it's the two remotes, one with the positive and one with the negative value. 
I'm currently observing the child. 
And the orange remote is a negative remote. 
She's just looking around, looking at me, hanging out. 
Then I turn around ... 
(Laughter) That's what she's going for. 
I'm not watching the child. 
He wants the mom to play with it, right? 
Take a safer route. 
I turn around ... 
(Laughter) He wasn't doing anything, either. 
Yeah, he feels awkward. 
(Laughter) Everyone knows that side-eyed glance, right? 
Study three, the two experimenters, one remote. 
The experimenter that reacted negatively towards pressing the remote is watching the child right now. 
She feels a little awkward, doesn't know what to do, relying on Mom. 
And then, she's going to turn around so that the experimenter that expressed a positive response is watching. 
Coast is clear -- now she's ready to play. 
(Laughter) So, as the data suggests, we found that children's button-pressing behavior was indeed influenced by the values and the instructions of the experimenter. 
Because in study one, children did not know what would be positively or negatively evaluated, they tended to take the safest route and wait until I turned my back to press the remote. 
Children in study two chose to press the positive remote significantly more when I was watching, but then once I turned my back, they immediately took the negative remote and started playing with it. 
Importantly, in a control study, where we removed the different values of the remotes -- so we simply said, "Oh, wow" after pressing either of the remotes -- children's button-pressing behavior no longer differed across conditions, suggesting that it was really the values that we gave the two remotes that drove the behavior in the previous study. 
Last but not least, children in study three chose to press a remote significantly more when the experimenter that expressed a positive value was watching, as opposed to the experimenter that had expressed a negative value. 
Not coincidentally, it is also around this age that children begin to show embarrassment in situations that might elicit a negative evaluation, such as looking at themselves in the mirror and noticing a mark on their nose. 
The equivalent of finding spinach in your teeth, for adults. 
(Laughter) So what can we say, based on these findings? 
Besides the fact that babies are actually really, really sneaky. 
(Laughter) From very early on, children, like adults, are sensitive to the values that we place on objects and behaviors. 
And importantly, they use these values to guide their behavior. 
Whether we're aware of it or not, we're constantly communicating values to those around us. 
Now, I don't mean values like "be kind" or "don't steal," although those are certainly values. 
I mean that we are constantly showing others, specifically our children, what is likeable, valuable and praiseworthy, and what is not. 
And a lot of the times, we actually do this without even noticing it. 
Psychologists study behavior to explore the contents of the mind, because our behavior often reflects our beliefs, our values and our desires. 
Here in Atlanta, we all believe the same thing. 
That Coke is better than Pepsi. 
(Applause) Now, this might have to do with the fact that Coke was invented in Atlanta. 
But regardless, this belief is expressed in the fact that most people will chose to drink Coke. 
In the same way, we are communicating a value when we mostly complement girls for their pretty hair or their pretty dress, but boys, for their intelligence. 
Or when we chose to offer candy, as opposed to nutritious food, as a reward for good behavior. 
Adults and children are incredibly effective at picking up values from these subtle behaviors. 
And in turn, this ends up shaping their own behavior. 
The research I have shared with you today suggests that this ability emerges very early in development, before we can even utter a complete sentence or are even potty-trained. 
And it becomes an integral part of who we grow up to be. 
So before I go, I'd like to invite you to contemplate on the values that we broadcast in day-to-day interactions, and how these values might be shaping the behavior of those around you. 
For example, what value is being broadcasted when we spend more time smiling at our phone than smiling with other people? 
Likewise, consider how your own behavior has been shaped by those around you, in ways you might not have considered before. 
To go back to our simple illustration, do you really prefer Coke over Pepsi? 
Or was this preference simply driven by what others around you valued? 
Parents and teachers certainly have the privilege to shape children's behavior. 
But it is important to remember that through the values we convey in simple day-to-day interactions, we all have the power to shape the behavior of those around us. 
Thank you. 
(Applause) 

So this is the first time I've told this story in public, the personal aspects of it. 
Yogi Berra was a world-famous baseball player who said, "If you come to a fork in the road, take it." 
Researchers had been, for more than a century, studying the immune system as a way to fight cancer, and cancer vaccines have, unfortunately, been disappointing. 
They've only worked in cancers caused by viruses, like cervical cancer or liver cancer. 
So cancer researchers basically gave up on the idea of using the immune system to fight cancer. 
And the immune system, in any case, did not evolve to fight cancer; it evolved to fight pathogens invading from the outside. 
So its job is to kill bacteria and viruses. 
And the reason the immune system has trouble with most cancers is that it doesn't invade from the outside; it evolves from its own cells. 
And so either the immune system does not recognize the cancer as a problem, or it attacks a cancer and also our normal cells, leading to autoimmune diseases like colitis or multiple sclerosis. 
So how do you get around that? 
Our answer turned out to be synthetic immune systems that are designed to recognize and kill cancer cells. 
That's right -- I said a synthetic immune system. 
You do that with genetic engineering and synthetic biology. 
We did it with the naturally occurring parts of the immune system, called B cells and T cells. 
These were our building blocks. 
T cells have evolved to kill cells infected with viruses, and B cells are the cells that make antibodies that are secreted and then bind to kill bacteria. 
Well, what if you combined these two functions in a way that was designed to repurpose them to fight cancer? 
We realized it would be possible to insert the genes for antibodies from B cells into T cells. 
So how do you do that? 
Well, we used an HIV virus as a Trojan horse to get past the T cells' immune system. 
The result is a chimera, a fantastic fire-breathing creature from Greek mythology, with a lion's head, a goat's body and a serpent's tail. 
So we decided that the paradoxical thing that we had created with our B-cell antibodies, our T cells carrier and the HIV Trojan horse should be called "Chimeric Antigen Receptor T cells," or CAR T cells. 
The virus also inserts genetic information to activate the T cells and program them into their killing mode. 
So when CAR T cells are injected into somebody with cancer, what happens when those CAR T cells see and bind to their tumor target? 
They act like supercharged killer T cells on steroids. 
They start this crash-defense buildup system in the body and literally divide and multiply by the millions, where they then attack and kill the tumor. 
All of this means that CAR T cells are the first living drug in medicine. 
CAR T cells break the mold. 
Unlike normal drugs that you take -- they do their job and get metabolized, and then you have to take them again -- CAR T cells stay alive and on the job for years. 
We have had CAR T cells stay in the bodies of our cancer patients now for more than eight years. 
And these designer cancer T cells, CAR T cells, have a calculated half-life of more than 17 years. 
So one infusion can do the job; they stay on patrol for the rest of your life. 
This is the beginning of a new paradigm in medicine. 
Now, there was one major challenge to these T-cell infusions. 
The only source of T cells that will work in a patient are your own T cells, unless you happen to have an identical twin. 
So for most of us, we're out of luck. 
So what we did was to make CAR T cells. 
We had to learn to grow the patient's own T cells. 
And we developed a robust platform for this in the 1990s. 
Then in 1997, we first tested CAR T cells in patients with advanced HIV-AIDS. 
And we found that those CAR T cells survived in the patients for more than a decade. 
And it improved their immune system and decreased their viruses, but it didn't cure them. 
So we went back to the laboratory, and over the next decade made improvements to the CAR T cell design. 
And by 2010, we began treating leukemia patients. 
And our team treated three patients with advanced chronic lymphocytic leukemia in 2012. 
It's a form of incurable leukemia that afflicts approximately 20,000 adults every year in the United States. 
The first patient that we treated was a retired Marine sergeant and a prison corrections officer. 
He had only weeks to live and had, in fact, already paid for his funeral. 
The cells were infused, and within days, he had high fevers. 
He developed multiple organ failures, was transferred to the ICU and was comatose. 
We thought he would die, and, in fact, he was given last rites. 
But then, another fork in the road happened. 
So, around 28 days after the CAR T cell infusion, he woke up, and the physicians finally examined him, and the cancer was gone. 
The big masses that had been there had melted. 
Bone marrow biopsies found no evidence of leukemia, and that year, in our first three patients we treated, two of three have had durable remissions now for eight years, and one had a partial remission. 
The CAR T cells had attacked the leukemia in these patients and had dissolved between 2.9 and 7.7 pounds of tumor in each patient. 
Their bodies had become veritable bioreactors for these CAR T cells, producing millions and millions of CAR T cells in the bone marrow, blood and tumor masses. 
And we discovered that these CAR T cells can punch far above their weight class, to use a boxing analogy. 
Just one CAR T cell can kill 1,000 tumor cells. 
That's right -- it's a ratio of one to a thousand. 
The CAR T cell and its daughter progeny cells can divide and divide and divide in the body until the last tumor cell is gone. 
There's no precedent for this in cancer medicine. 
The first two patients who had full remission remain today leukemia-free, and we think they are cured. 
These are people who had run out of options, and by all traditional methods they had, they were like modern-day Lazarus cases. 
All I can say is: thank goodness for those forks in the road. 
Our next step was to get permission to treat children with acute leukemia, the most common form of cancer in kids. 
The first patient we enrolled on the trial was Emily Whitehead, and at that time, she was six years old. 
She had gone through a series of chemotherapy and radiation treatments over several years, and her leukemia had always come back. 
In fact, it had come back three times. 
When we first saw her, Emily was very ill. 
Her official diagnosis was advanced, incurable leukemia. 
Cancer had invaded her bone marrow, her liver, her spleen. 
And when we infused her with the CAR T cells in the spring of April 2012, over the next few days, she did not get better. 
She got worse, and in fact, much worse. 
As our prison corrections officer had in 2010, she, in 2012, was admitted to the ICU, and this was the scariest fork in the whole road of this story. 
By day three, she was comatose and on life support for kidney failure, lung failure and coma. 
Her fever was as high as 106 degrees Fahrenheit for three days. 
And we didn't know what was causing those fevers. 
We did all the standard blood tests for infections, and we could not find an infectious cause for her fever. 
But we did find something very unusual in her blood that had never been seen before in medicine. 
She had elevated levels of a protein called interleukin-6, or IL-6, in her blood. 
It was, in fact, more than a thousandfold above the normal levels. 
And here's where yet another fork in the road came in. 
By sheer coincidence, one of my daughters has a form of pediatric arthritis. 
And as a result, I had been following as a cancer doc, experimental therapies for arthritis for my daughter, in case she would need them. 
And it so happened that just months before Emily was admitted to the hospital, a new therapy had been approved by the FDA to treat elevated levels of interleukin-6. 
And it was approved for the arthritis that my daughter had. 
It's called tocilizumab. 
And, in fact, it had just been added to the pharmacy at Emily's hospital, for arthritis. 
So when we found Emily had these very high levels of IL-6, I called her doctors in the ICU and said, "Why don't you treat her with this arthritis drug?" 
They said I was a cowboy for suggesting that. 
And since her fever and low blood pressure had not responded to any other therapy, her doctor quickly asked permission to the institutional review board, her parents, and everybody, of course, said yes. 
And they tried it, and the results were nothing short of striking. 
Within hours after treatment with tocilizumab, Emily began to improve very rapidly. 
Twenty-three days after her treatment, she was declared cancer-free. 
And today, she's 12 years old and still in remission. 
(Applause) So we now call this violent reaction of the high fevers and coma, following CAR T cells, cytokine release syndrome, or CRS. 
We've found that it occurs in nearly all patients who respond to the therapy. 
But it does not happen in those patients who fail to respond. 
So paradoxically, our patients now hope for these high fevers after therapy, which feels like "the worst flu in their life," when they get CAR T-cell therapies. 
They hope for this reaction because they know it's part of the twisting and turning path back to health. 
Unfortunately, not every patient recovers. 
Patients who do not get CRS are often those who are not cured. 
So there's a strong link now between CRS and the ability of the immune system to eradicate leukemia. 
That's why last summer, when the FDA approved CAR T cells for leukemia, they also co-approved the use of tocilizumab to block the IL-6 effects and the accompanying CRS in these patients. 
That was a very unusual event in medical history. 
Emily's doctors have now completed further trials and reported that 27 out of 30 patients, the first 30 we treated, or 90 percent, had a complete remission after CAR T cells, within a month. 
A 90 percent complete remission rate in patients with advanced cancer is unheard of in more than 50 years of cancer research. 
In fact, companies often declare success in a cancer trial if 15 percent of the patients had a complete response rate. 
A remarkable study appeared in the "New England Journal of Medicine" in 2013. 
An international study has since confirmed those results. 
And that led to the approval by the FDA for pediatric and young adult leukemia in August of 2017. 
So as a first-ever approval of a cell and gene therapy, CAR T-cell therapy has also been tested now in adults with refractory lymphoma. 
This disease afflicts about 20,000 a year in the United States. 
The results were equally impressive and have been durable to date. 
And six months ago, the FDA approved the therapy of this advanced lymphoma with CAR T cells. 
So now there are many labs and physicians and scientists around the world who have tested CAR T cells across many different diseases, and understandably, we're all thrilled with the rapid pace of advancement. 
We're so grateful to see patients who were formerly terminal return to healthy lives, as Emily has. 
We're thrilled to see long remissions that may, in fact, be a cure. 
At the same time, we're also concerned about the financial cost. 
It can cost up to 150,000 dollars to make the CAR T cells for each patient. 
And when you add in the cost of treating CRS and other complications, the cost can reach one million dollars per patient. 
We must remember that the cost of failure, though, is even worse. 
The current noncurative therapies for cancer are also expensive and, in addition, the patient dies. 
So, of course, we'd like to see research done now to make this more efficient and increase affordability to all patients. 
Fortunately, this is a new and evolving field, and as with many other new therapies and services, prices will come down as industry learns to do things more efficiently. 
When I think about all the forks in the road that have led to CAR T-cell therapy, there is one thing that strikes me as very important. 
We're reminded that discoveries of this magnitude don't happen overnight. 
CAR T-cell therapies came to us after a 30-year journey, along a road full of setbacks and surprises. 
In all this world of instant gratification and 24/7, on-demand results, scientists require persistence, vision and patience to rise above all that. 
They can see that the fork in the road is not always a dilemma or a detour; sometimes, even though we may not know it at the time, the fork is the way home. 
Thank you very much. 
(Applause) 

When people meet me for the first time on my job, they often feel inspired to share a revelation they've had about me, and it kind of goes something like this. 
"Hey, I know why police chiefs like to share their deep, dark secrets with you. 
Phil, with your PhD in psychology, and your shiny bald head, you're basically the Black Dr. Phil, right?" 
(Laughter) And for each and every person who's ever said that to me I do want to say thank you because that was the first time I ever heard that joke. 
(Laughter) But for everybody else, I really hope you'll believe me when I tell you no police chief likes talking to me because they think I'm a clinical psychologist. 
And also I'm not. 
I have no idea what your mother did to you, and I can't help. 
(Laughter) Police chiefs like talking to me because I'm an expert on a problem that feels impossible for them to solve: racism in their profession. 
Now my expertise comes from being a scientist who studies how our minds learn to associate Blackness and crime and misperceive Black children as older than they actually are. 
It also comes from studying actual police behavior, which is how I know that every year, about one in five adults in the United States has contact with law enforcement. 
Out of those, about a million are targeted for police use of force. 
And if you're Black, you're two to four times more likely to be targeted for that force than if you're white. 
But it also comes from knowing what those statistics feel like. 
I've experienced the fear of seeing an officer unclip their gun and the panic of realizing that someone might mistake my 13-year-old godson as old enough to be a threat. 
So when a police chief, or a pastor, or an imam, or a mother -- when they call me after an officer shoots another unarmed Black child, I understand a bit of the pain in their voice. 
It's the pain of a heart breaking when it fails to solve a deadly problem. 
Breaking from trying to do something that feels simultaneously necessary and impossible. 
The way trying to fix racism usually feels. 
Necessary and impossible. 
So, police chiefs like talking to me because I'm an expert, but I doubt they'd be lining up to lie down on Dr. Phil's couch if I told them all their problems were hopeless. 
All of my research, and the decade of work I've done with my center -- the Center for Policing Equity -- actually leads me to a hopeful conclusion amidst all the heartbreak of race in America, which is this: trying to solve racism feels impossible because our definition of racism makes it impossible -- but it doesn't have to be that way. 
So here's what I mean. 
The most common definition of racism is that racist behaviors are the product of contaminated hearts and minds. 
When you listen to the way we talk about trying to cure racism, you'll hear it. 
"We need to stamp out hatred. 
We need to combat ignorance," right? 
It's hearts and minds. 
Now the only problem with that definition is that it's completely wrong -- both scientifically and otherwise. 
One of the foundational insights of social psychology is that attitudes are very weak predictors of behaviors, but more importantly than that, no Black community has ever taken to the streets to demand that white people would love us more. 
Communities march to stop the killing, because racism is about behaviors, not feelings. 
And even when civil rights leaders like King and Fannie Lou Hamer used the language of love, the racism they fought, that was segregation and brutality. 
It's actions over feelings. 
And every one of those leaders would agree, if a definition of racism makes it harder to see the injuries racism causes, that's not just wrong. 
A definition that cares about the intentions of abusers more than the harms to the abused -- that definition of racism is racist. 
But when we change the definition of racism from attitudes to behaviors, we transform that problem from impossible to solvable. 
Because you can measure behaviors. 
And when you can measure a problem, you can tap into one of the only universal rules of organizational success. 
You've got a problem or a goal, you measure it, you hold yourself accountable to that metric. 
So if every other organization measures success this way, why can't we do that in policing? 
It turns out we actually already do. 
Police departments already practice data-driven accountability, it's just for crime. 
The vast majority of police departments across the United States use a system called CompStat. 
It's a process that, when you use it right, it identifies crime data, it tracks it and identifies patterns, and then it allows departments to hold themselves accountable to public safety goals. 
It usually works either by directing police attentions and police resources, or changing police behavior once they show up. 
So if I see a string of muggings in that neighborhood, I'm going to want to increase patrols in that neighborhood. 
If I see a spike in homicides, I'm going to want to talk to the community to find out why and collaborate on changes on police behavior to tamp down the violence. 
Now when you define racism in terms of measurable behaviors, you can do the same thing. 
You can create a CompStat for justice. 
That's exactly what the Center for Policing Equity has been doing. 
So let me tell you how that works. 
After a police department invites us in, we handle the legal stuff, we engage with the community, our next step is to analyze their data. 
The goal of these analyses is to determine how much do crime, poverty, neighborhood demographics predict, let's say, police use of force? 
Let's say that those factors predict police will use force on this many Black people. 
There? 
So our next question is, how many Black people actually are targeted for police use of force? 
Let's say it's this many. 
So what's up with the gap? 
Well, a big portion of the gap is the difference between what's predicted by things police can't control and what's predicted by things police can control -- their policies and their behaviors. 
And what we're looking for are the types of contact or the areas in the city where that gap is biggest, because then we can tell our partners, "Look here. Solve this problem first." 
It's actually the kind of therapy police chiefs can get behind, because there is nothing so inspiring in the face of our history of racism as a solvable problem. 
Look, if the community in Minneapolis asked their police department to remedy the moral failings of race in policing, I'm not sure they know how to do that. 
But if instead the community says, "Hey, you're data say you're beating up a lot of homeless folks. 
You want to knock that off?" 
That's something police can learn how to do. 
And they did. 
So in 2015, the Minneapolis PD let us know their community was concerned they were using force too often. 
So we showed them how to leverage their own data to identify situations where force could be avoided. 
And when you look at those data, you'll see that a disproportionate number of their use-of-force incidents, they involved somebody who's homeless, in mental distress, has a substance abuse issue or some combination of all three -- more than you expect based on those factors I was just telling you about. 
So right there's the gap. 
Next question is why. 
Well, it turns out homeless folks often need services. 
And when those services are unavailable, when they can't get their meds, they lose their spot in the shelter, they're more likely to engage in behaviors that end up with folks calling the cops. 
And when the cops show up, they're more likely to resist intervention, oftentimes because they haven't actually done anything illegal, they're literally just living outside. 
The problem wasn't a need to train officers differently in Minneapolis. 
The problem was the fact that folks were using the cops to "treat" substance abuse and homelessness in the first place. 
So the city of Minneapolis found a way to deliver social services and city resources to the homeless community before anybody ever called the cops. 
(Applause) Now the problem isn't always homelessness, right? 
Sometimes the problem is fear of immigration enforcement, like it was in Salt Lake City, or it is in Houston, where the chiefs had to come forward and say, "We're not going to deport you just for calling 911." 
Or the problem is foot pursuits, like it was in Las Vegas, where they had to train their officers to slow down and take a breath instead of allowing the adrenaline in that situation to escalate it. 
It's searches in Oakland; it's pulling folks out of cars in San Jose; it's the way that they patrol the neighborhoods that make up Zone 3 in Pittsburgh and the Black neighborhoods closest to the waterfront in Baltimore. 
But in each city, if we can give them a solvable problem, they get busy solving it. 
And together our partners have seen an average of 25 percent fewer arrests, fewer use-of-force incidents and 13 percent fewer officer-related injuries. 
Essentially, by identifying the biggest gaps and directing police attentions to solving it, we can deliver a data-driven vaccine against racial disparities in policing. 
Right now, we have the capacity to partner with about 40 cities at a time. 
That means if we want the United States to stop feeling exhausted from trying to solve an impossible problem, we're going to need a lot more infrastructure. 
Because our goal is to have our tools be able to scale the brilliance of dedicated organizers and reform-minded chiefs. 
So to get there we're going to need the kind of collective will that desegregated schools and won the franchise for the sons and daughters of former slaves so that we can build a kind of health care system capable of delivering our vaccine across the country. 
Because our audacious idea is to deliver a CompStat for justice to departments serving 100 million people across the United States in the next five years. 
(Applause and cheers) Doing that would mean arming about a third of the United States with tools to reduce racial disparities in police stops, arrests and use of force, but also tools to reduce predatory cash bail and mass incarceration, family instability and chronic mental health and substance abuse issues, and every other ill that our broken criminal-legal systems aggravate. 
Because every unnecessary arrest we can prevent saves a family from the terrifying journey through each one of those systems. 
Just like every gun we can leave holstered saves an entire community from a lifetime of grief. 
Look, each and every one of us, we measure the things that matter to us. 
Businesses measure profit; good students keep track of their grades; families chart the growth of their children with pencil markings in doorframes. 
We all measure the things that matter most to us, which is why we feel the neglect when nobody's bothering to measure anything at all. 
For the past quarter millennium, we've defined the problems of race and policing in a way that's functionally impossible to measure. 
But now the science says we can just change that definition. 
And the folks at the Center for Policing Equity, I actually think we may have measured more police behavior than any one in human history. 
And that means that once we have the will and the resources to do it, this could be the generation that stops feeling like racism is an unsolvable problem and instead sees that what's been necessary for far too long is possible. 
Thank you. 
(Applause and cheers) 

Do you feel trapped in a broken economic model? 
A model that's trashing the living world and threatens the lives of our descendants? 
A model that excludes billions of people while making a handful unimaginably rich? 
That sorts us into winners and losers, and then blames the losers for their misfortune? 
Welcome to neoliberalism, the zombie doctrine that never seems to die, however comprehensively it is discredited. 
Now you might have imagined that the financial crisis of 2008 would have led to the collapse of neoliberalism. 
After all, it exposed its central features, which were deregulating business and finance, tearing down public protections, throwing us into extreme competition with each other, as, well, just a little bit flawed. 
And intellectually, it did collapse. 
But still, it dominates our lives. 
Why? 
Well, I believe the answer is that we have not yet produced a new story with which to replace it. 
Stories are the means by which we navigate the world. 
They allow us to interpret its complex and contradictory signals. 
When we want to make sense of something, the sense we seek is not scientific sense but narrative fidelity. 
Does what we are hearing reflect the way that we expect humans and the world to behave? 
Does it hang together? 
Does it progress as a story should progress? 
Now, we are creatures of narrative, and a string of facts and figures, however important facts and figures are -- and, you know, I'm an empiricist, I believe in facts and figures -- but those facts and figures have no power to displace a persuasive story. 
The only thing that can replace a story is a story. 
You cannot take away someone's story without giving them a new one. 
And it's not just stories in general that we are attuned to, but particular narrative structures. 
There are a number of basic plots that we use again and again, and in politics there is one basic plot which turns out to be tremendously powerful, and I call this "the restoration story." 
It goes as follows. 
Disorder afflicts the land, caused by powerful and nefarious forces working against the interests of humanity. 
But the hero will revolt against this disorder, fight those powerful forces, against the odds overthrow them and restore harmony to the land. 
You've heard this story before. 
It's the Bible story. 
It's the "Harry Potter" story. 
It's the "Lord of the Rings" story. 
It's the "Narnia" story. 
But it's also the story that has accompanied almost every political and religious transformation going back millennia. 
In fact, we could go as far as to say that without a powerful new restoration story, a political and religious transformation might not be able to happen. 
It's that important. 
After laissez-faire economics triggered the Great Depression, John Maynard Keynes sat down to write a new economics, and what he did was to tell a restoration story, and it went something like this. 
Disorder afflicts the land! 
(Laughter) Caused by the powerful and nefarious forces of the economic elite, which have captured the world's wealth. 
But the hero of the story, the enabling state, supported by working class and middle class people, will contest that disorder, will fight those powerful forces by redistributing wealth, and through spending public money on public goods will generate income and jobs, restoring harmony to the land. 
Now like all good restoration stories, this one resonated across the political spectrum. 
Democrats and Republicans, labor and conservatives, left and right all became, broadly, Keynesian. 
Then, when Keynesianism ran into trouble in the 1970s, the neoliberals, people like Friedrich Hayek and Milton Friedman, came forward with their new restoration story, and it went something like this. 
You'll never guess what's coming. 
(Laughter) Disorder afflicts the land! 
Caused by the powerful and nefarious forces of the overmighty state, whose collectivizing tendencies crush freedom and individualism and opportunity. 
But the hero of the story, the entrepreneur, will fight those powerful forces, roll back the state, and through creating wealth and opportunity, restore harmony to the land. 
And that story also resonated across the political spectrum. 
Republicans and Democrats, conservatives and labor, they all became, broadly, neoliberal. 
Opposite stories with an identical narrative structure. 
Then, in 2008, the neoliberal story fell apart, and its opponents came forward with ... 
nothing. 
No new restoration story! 
The best they had to offer was a watered-down neoliberalism or a microwaved Keynesianism. 
And that is why we're stuck. 
Without that new story, we are stuck with the old failed story that keeps on failing. 
Despair is the state we fall into when our imagination fails. 
When we have no story that explains the present and describes the future, hope evaporates. 
Political failure is at heart a failure of imagination. 
Without a restoration story that can tell us where we need to go, nothing is going to change, but with such a restoration story, almost everything can change. 
The story we need to tell is a story which will appeal to as wide a range of people as possible, crossing political fault lines. 
It should resonate with deep needs and desires. 
It should be simple and intelligible, and it should be grounded in reality. 
Now, I admit that all of this sounds like a bit of a tall order. 
But I believe that in Western nations, there is actually a story like this waiting to be told. 
Over the past few years, there's been a fascinating convergence of findings in several different sciences, in psychology and anthropology and neuroscience and evolutionary biology, and they all tell us something pretty amazing: that human beings have got this massive capacity for altruism. 
Sure, we all have a bit of selfishness and greed inside us, but in most people, those are not our dominant values. 
And we also turn out to be the supreme cooperators. 
We survived the African savannas, despite being weaker and slower than our predators and most of our prey, by an amazing ability to engage in mutual aid, and that urge to cooperate has been hardwired into our minds through natural selection. 
These are the central, crucial facts about humankind: our amazing altruism and cooperation. 
But something has gone horribly wrong. 
Disorder afflicts the land. 
(Laughter) Our good nature has been thwarted by several forces, but I think the most powerful of them is the dominant political narrative of our times, which tells us that we should live in extreme individualism and competition with each other. 
It pushes us to fight each other, to fear and mistrust each other. 
It atomizes society. 
It weakens the social bonds that make our lives worth living. 
And into that vacuum grow these violent, intolerant forces. 
We are a society of altruists, but we are governed by psychopaths. 
(Applause) But it doesn't have to be like this. 
It really doesn't, because we have this incredible capacity for togetherness and belonging, and by invoking that capacity, we can recover those amazing components of our humanity: our altruism and cooperation. 
Where there is atomization, we can build a thriving civic life with a rich participatory culture. 
Where we find ourselves crushed between market and state, we can build an economics that respects both people and planet. 
And we can create this economics around that great neglected sphere, the commons. 
The commons is neither market nor state, capitalism nor communism, but it consists of three main elements: a particular resource; a particular community that manages that resource; and the rules and negotiations the community develops to manage it. 
Think of community broadband or community energy cooperatives or the shared land for growing fruit and vegetables that in Britain we call allotments. 
A common can't be sold, it can't be given away, and its benefits are shared equally among the members of the community. 
Where we have been ignored and exploited, we can revive our politics. 
We can recover democracy from the people who have captured it. 
We can use new rules and methods of elections to ensure that financial power never trumps democratic power again. 
(Applause) Representative democracy should be tempered by participatory democracy so that we can refine our political choices, and that choice should be exercised as much as possible at the local level. 
If something can be decided locally, it shouldn't be determined nationally. 
And I call all this the politics of belonging. 
Now, I think this has got the potential to appeal across quite a wide range of people, and the reason for this is that among the very few values that both left and right share are belonging and community. 
And we might mean slightly different things by them, but at least we start with some language in common. 
In fact, you can see a lot of politics as being a search for belonging. 
Even fascists seek community, albeit a frighteningly homogenous community where everyone looks the same and wears the same uniform and chants the same slogans. 
What we need to create is a community based on bridging networks, not bonding networks. 
Now a bonding network brings together people from a homogenous group, whereas a bridging network brings together people from different groups. 
And my belief is that if we create sufficiently rich and vibrant bridging communities, we can thwart the urge for people to burrow into the security of a homogenous bonding community defending themselves against the other. 
So in summary, our new story could go something like this. 
Disorder afflicts the land! 
(Laughter) Caused by the powerful and nefarious forces of people who say there's no such thing as society, who tell us that our highest purpose in life is to fight like stray dogs over a dustbin. 
But the heroes of the story, us, we'll revolt against this disorder. 
We will fight those nefarious forces by building rich, engaging, inclusive and generous communities, and, in doing so, we will restore harmony to the land. 
(Applause) Now whether or not you feel this is the right story, I hope you'll agree that we need one. 
We need a new restoration story, which is going to guide us out of the mess we're in, which tells us why we're in the mess and tells us how to get out of that mess. 
And that story, if we tell it right, will infect the minds of people across the political spectrum. 
Our task is to tell the story that lights the path to a better world. 
Thank you. 
(Applause) 

Just over a mile away from here, in Edinburgh's Old Town, is Panmure House. 
Panmure House was the home of the world-renowned Scottish economist Adam Smith. 
In his important work "The Wealth of Nations," Adam Smith argued, amongst many other things, that the measurement of a country's wealth was not just its gold and silver reserves. 
It was the totality of the country's production and commerce. 
I guess it was one of the earliest descriptions of what we now know today as gross domestic product, GDP. 
Now, in the years since, of course, that measurement of production and commerce, GDP, has become ever more important, to the point that today -- and I don't believe this is what Adam Smith would have intended -- that it is often seen as the most important measurement of a country's overall success. 
And my argument today is that it is time for that to change. 
You know, what we choose to measure as a country matters. 
It really matters, because it drives political focus, it drives public activity. 
And against that context, I think the limitations of GDP as a measurement of a country's success are all too obvious. 
You know, GDP measures the output of all of our work, but it says nothing about the nature of that work, about whether that work is worthwhile or fulfilling. 
It puts a value, for example, on illegal drug consumption, but not on unpaid care. 
It values activity in the short term that boosts the economy, even if that activity is hugely damaging to the sustainability of our planet in the longer term. 
And we reflect on the past decade of political and economic upheaval, of growing inequalities, and when we look ahead to the challenges of the climate emergency, increasing automation, an aging population, then I think the argument for the case for a much broader definition of what it means to be successful as a country, as a society, is compelling, and increasingly so. 
And that is why Scotland, in 2018, took the lead, took the initiative in establishing a new network called the Wellbeing Economy Governments group, bringing together as founding members the countries of Scotland, Iceland and New Zealand, for obvious reasons. 
We're sometimes called the SIN countries, although our focus is very much on the common good. 
And the purpose of this group is to challenge that focus on the narrow measurement of GDP. 
To say that, yes, economic growth matters -- it is important -- but it is not all that is important. 
And growth in GDP should not be pursued at any or all cost. 
In fact, the argument of that group is that the goal, the objective of economic policy should be collective well-being: how happy and healthy a population is, not just how wealthy a population is. 
And I'll touch on the policy implications of that in a moment. 
But I think, particularly in the world we live in today, it has a deeper resonance. 
You know, when we focus on well-being, we start a conversation that provokes profound and fundamental questions. 
What really matters to us in our lives? 
What do we value in the communities we live in? 
What kind of country, what kind of society, do we really want to be? 
And when we engage people in those questions, in finding the answers to those questions, then I believe that we have a much better chance of addressing the alienation and disaffection from politics that is so prevalent in so many countries across the developed world today. 
In policy terms, this journey for Scotland started back in 2007, when we published what we call our National Performance Framework, looking at the range of indicators that we measure ourselves against. 
And those indicators are as varied as income inequality, the happiness of children, access to green spaces, access to housing. 
None of these are captured in GDP statistics, but they are all fundamental to a healthy and a happy society. 
(Applause) And that broader approach is at the heart of our economic strategy, where we give equal importance to tackling inequality as we do to economic competitiveness. 
It drives our commitment to fair work, making sure that work is fulfilling and well-paid. 
It's behind our decision to establish a Just Transition Commission to guide our path to a carbon zero economy. 
We know from economic transformations of the past that if we're not careful, there are more losers than winners. 
And as we face up to the challenges of climate change and automation, we must not make those mistakes again. 
The work we're doing here in Scotland is, I think, significant, but we have much, much to learn from other countries. 
I mentioned, a moment ago, our partner nations in the Wellbeing network: Iceland and New Zealand. 
It's worth noting, and I'll leave it to you to decide whether this is relevant or not, that all three of these countries are currently led by women. 
(Applause) They, too, are doing great work. 
New Zealand, in 2019, publishing its first Wellbeing Budget, with mental health at its heart; Iceland leading the way on equal pay, childcare and paternity rights -- not policies that we immediately think of when we talk about creating a wealthy economy, but policies that are fundamental to a healthy economy and a happy society. 
I started with Adam Smith and "The Wealth of Nations." 
In Adam Smith's earlier work, "The Theory of Moral Sentiments," which I think is just as important, he made the observation that the value of any government is judged in proportion to the extent that it makes its people happy. 
I think that is a good founding principle for any group of countries focused on promoting well-being. 
None of us have all of the answers, not even Scotland, the birthplace of Adam Smith. 
But in the world we live in today, with growing divides and inequalities, with disaffection and alienation, it is more important than ever that we ask and find the answers to those questions and promote a vision of society that has well-being, not just wealth, at its very heart. 
(Applause) You are right now in the beautiful, sunny capital city ... 
(Laughter) of the country that led the world in the Enlightenment, the country that helped lead the world into the industrial age, the country that right now is helping to lead the world into the low carbon age. 
I want, and I'm determined, that Scotland will also be the country that helps change the focus of countries and governments across the world to put well-being at the heart of everything that we do. 
I certainly believe we owe that to the next generation and all those that come after us. 
And if we do that, led here from the country of the Enlightenment, then I think we create a better, healthier, fairer and happier society here at home. 
And we play our part in Scotland in building a fairer, happier world as well. 
Thank you very much. 
(Applause) 

Recently, the leadership team of an American supermarket chain decided that their business needed to get a lot more efficient. 
So they embraced their digital transformation with zeal. 
Out went the teams supervising meat, veg, bakery, and in came an algorithmic task allocator. 
Now, instead of people working together, each employee went, clocked in, got assigned a task, did it, came back for more. 
This was scientific management on steroids, standardizing and allocating work. 
It was super efficient. 
Well, not quite, because the task allocator didn't know when a customer was going to drop a box of eggs, couldn't predict when some crazy kid was going to knock over a display, or when the local high school decided that everybody needed to bring in coconuts the next day. 
(Laughter) Efficiency works really well when you can predict exactly what you're going to need. 
But when the anomalous or unexpected comes along -- kids, customers, coconuts -- well, then efficiency is no longer your friend. 
This has become a really crucial issue, this ability to deal with the unexpected, because the unexpected is becoming the norm. 
It's why experts and forecasters are reluctant to predict anything more than 400 days out. 
Why? 
Because over the last 20 or 30 years, much of the world has gone from being complicated to being complex -- which means that yes, there are patterns, but they don't repeat themselves regularly. 
It means that very small changes can make a disproportionate impact. 
And it means that expertise won't always suffice, because the system just keeps changing too fast. 
So what that means is that there's a huge amount in the world that kind of defies forecasting now. 
It's why the Bank of England will say yes, there will be another crash, but we don't know why or when. 
We know that climate change is real, but we can't predict where forest fires will break out, and we don't know which factories are going to flood. 
It's why companies are blindsided when plastic straws and bags and bottled water go from staples to rejects overnight, and baffled when a change in social mores turns stars into pariahs and colleagues into outcasts: ineradicable uncertainty. 
In an environment that defies so much forecasting, efficiency won't just not help us, it specifically undermines and erodes our capacity to adapt and respond. 
So if efficiency is no longer our guiding principle, how should we address the future? 
What kind of thinking is really going to help us? 
What sort of talents must we be sure to defend? 
I think that, where in the past we used to think a lot about just in time management, now we have to start thinking about just in case, preparing for events that are generally certain but specifically remain ambiguous. 
One example of this is the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness, CEPI. 
We know there will be more epidemics in future, but we don't know where or when or what. 
So we can't plan. 
But we can prepare. 
So CEPI's developing multiple vaccines for multiple diseases, knowing that they can't predict which vaccines are going to work or which diseases will break out. 
So some of those vaccines will never be used. 
That's inefficient. 
But it's robust, because it provides more options, and it means that we don't depend on a single technological solution. 
Epidemic responsiveness also depends hugely on people who know and trust each other. 
But those relationships take time to develop, time that is always in short supply when an epidemic breaks out. 
So CEPI is developing relationships, friendships, alliances now knowing that some of those may never be used. 
That's inefficient, a waste of time, perhaps, but it's robust. 
You can see robust thinking in financial services, too. 
In the past, banks used to hold much less capital than they're required to today, because holding so little capital, being too efficient with it, is what made the banks so fragile in the first place. 
Now, holding more capital looks and is inefficient. 
But it's robust, because it protects the financial system against surprises. 
Countries that are really serious about climate change know that they have to adopt multiple solutions, multiple forms of renewable energy, not just one. 
The countries that are most advanced have been working for years now, changing their water and food supply and healthcare systems, because they recognize that by the time they have certain prediction, that information may very well come too late. 
You can take the same approach to trade wars, and many countries do. 
Instead of depending on a single huge trading partner, they try to be everybody's friends, because they know they can't predict which markets might suddenly become unstable. 
It's time-consuming and expensive, negotiating all these deals, but it's robust because it makes their whole economy better defended against shocks. 
It's particularly a strategy adopted by small countries that know they'll never have the market muscle to call the shots, so it's just better to have too many friends. 
But if you're stuck in one of these organizations that's still kind of captured by the efficiency myth, how do you start to change it? 
Try some experiments. 
In the Netherlands, home care nursing used to be run pretty much like the supermarket: standardized and prescribed work to the minute: nine minutes on Monday, seven minutes on Wednesday, eight minutes on Friday. 
The nurses hated it. 
So one of them, Jos de Blok, proposed an experiment. 
Since every patient is different, and we don't quite know exactly what they'll need, why don't we just leave it to the nurses to decide? 
Sound reckless? 
(Laughter) (Applause) In his experiment, Jos found the patients got better in half the time, and costs fell by 30 percent. 
When I asked Jos what had surprised him about his experiment, he just kind of laughed and he said, "Well, I had no idea it could be so easy to find such a huge improvement, because this isn't the kind of thing you can know or predict sitting at a desk or staring at a computer screen." 
So now this form of nursing has proliferated across the Netherlands and around the world. 
But in every new country it still starts with experiments, because each place is slightly and unpredictably different. 
Of course, not all experiments work. 
Jos tried a similar approach to the fire service and found it didn't work because the service is just too centralized. 
Failed experiments look inefficient, but they're often the only way you can figure out how the real world works. 
So now he's trying teachers. 
Experiments like that require creativity and not a little bravery. 
In England -- I was about to say in the UK, but in England -- (Laughter) (Applause) In England, the leading rugby team, or one of the leading rugby teams, is Saracens. 
The manager and the coach there realized that all the physical training they do and the data-driven conditioning that they do has become generic; really, all the teams do exactly the same thing. 
So they risked an experiment. 
They took the whole team away, even in match season, on ski trips and to look at social projects in Chicago. 
This was expensive, it was time-consuming, and it could be a little risky putting a whole bunch of rugby players on a ski slope, right? 
(Laughter) But what they found was that the players came back with renewed bonds of loyalty and solidarity. 
And now when they're on the pitch under incredible pressure, they manifest what the manager calls "poise" -- an unflinching, unwavering dedication to each other. 
Their opponents are in awe of this, but still too in thrall to efficiency to try it. 
At a London tech company, Verve, the CEO measures just about everything that moves, but she couldn't find anything that made any difference to the company's productivity. 
So she devised an experiment that she calls "Love Week": a whole week where each employee has to look for really clever, helpful, imaginative things that a counterpart does, call it out and celebrate it. 
It takes a huge amount of time and effort; lots of people would call it distracting. 
But it really energizes the business and makes the whole company more productive. 
Preparedness, coalition-building, imagination, experiments, bravery -- in an unpredictable age, these are tremendous sources of resilience and strength. 
They aren't efficient, but they give us limitless capacity for adaptation, variation and invention. 
And the less we know about the future, the more we're going to need these tremendous sources of human, messy, unpredictable skills. 
But in our growing dependence on technology, we're asset-stripping those skills. 
Every time we use technology to nudge us through a decision or a choice or to interpret how somebody's feeling or to guide us through a conversation, we outsource to a machine what we could, can do ourselves, and it's an expensive trade-off. 
The more we let machines think for us, the less we can think for ourselves. 
The more -- (Applause) The more time doctors spend staring at digital medical records, the less time they spend looking at their patients. 
The more we use parenting apps, the less we know our kids. 
The more time we spend with people that we're predicted and programmed to like, the less we can connect with people who are different from ourselves. 
And the less compassion we need, the less compassion we have. 
What all of these technologies attempt to do is to force-fit a standardized model of a predictable reality onto a world that is infinitely surprising. 
What gets left out? 
Anything that can't be measured -- which is just about everything that counts. 
(Applause) Our growing dependence on technology risks us becoming less skilled, more vulnerable to the deep and growing complexity of the real world. 
Now, as I was thinking about the extremes of stress and turbulence that we know we will have to confront, I went and I talked to a number of chief executives whose own businesses had gone through existential crises, when they teetered on the brink of collapse. 
These were frank, gut-wrenching conversations. 
Many men wept just remembering. 
So I asked them: "What kept you going through this?" 
And they all had exactly the same answer. 
"It wasn't data or technology," they said. 
"It was my friends and my colleagues who kept me going." 
One added, "It was pretty much the opposite of the gig economy." 
But then I went and I talked to a group of young, rising executives, and I asked them, "Who are your friends at work?" 
And they just looked blank. 
"There's no time." 
"They're too busy." 
"It's not efficient." 
Who, I wondered, is going to give them imagination and stamina and bravery when the storms come? 
Anyone who tries to tell you that they know the future is just trying to own it, a spurious kind of manifest destiny. 
The harder, deeper truth is that the future is uncharted, that we can't map it till we get there. 
But that's OK, because we have so much imagination -- if we use it. 
We have deep talents of inventiveness and exploration -- if we apply them. 
We are brave enough to invent things we've never seen before. 
Lose those skills, and we are adrift. 
But hone and develop them, we can make any future we choose. 
Thank you. 
(Applause) 

[This talk contains graphic images] So I'm sitting across from Pedro, the coyote, the human smuggler, in his cement block apartment, in a dusty Reynosa neighborhood somewhere on the US-Mexico border. 
It's 3am. 
The day before, he had asked me to come back to his apartment. 
We would talk man to man. 
He wanted me to be there at night and alone. 
I didn't know if he was setting me up, but I knew I wanted to tell his story. 
He asked me, "What will you do if one of these pollitos, or migrants, slips into the water and can't swim? 
Will you simply take your pictures and watch him drown? 
Or will you jump in and help me?" 
At that moment, Pedro wasn't a cartoonish TV version of a human smuggler. 
He was just a young man, about my age, asking me some really tough questions. 
This was life and death. 
The next night, I photographed Pedro as he swam the Rio Grande, crossing with a group of young migrants into the United States. 
Real lives hung in the balance every time he crossed people. 
For the last 20 years, I've documented one of the largest transnational migrations in world history, which has resulted in millions of undocumented people living in the United States. 
The vast majority of these people leave Central America and Mexico to escape grinding poverty and extreme levels of social violence. 
I photograph intimate moments of everyday people's lives, of people living in the shadows. 
Time and again, I've witnessed resilient individuals in extremely challenging situations constructing practical ways to improve their lives. 
With these photographs, I place you squarely in the middle of these moments and ask you to think about them as if you knew them. 
This body of work is a historical document, a time capsule that can teach us not only about migration, but about society and ourselves. 
I started the project in the year 2000. 
The migrant trail has taught me how we treat our most vulnerable residents in the United States. 
It has taught me about violence and pain and hope and resilience and struggle and sacrifice. 
It has taught me firsthand that rhetoric and political policy directly impact real people. 
And most of all, the migrant trail has taught me that everyone who embarks on it is changed forever. 
I began this project in the year 2000 by documenting a group of day laborers on Chicago’s Northwest side. 
Each day, the men would wake up at 5am, go to a McDonald's, where they would stand outside and wait to jump into strangers' work vans, in the hopes of finding a job for the day. 
They earned five dollars an hour, had no job security, no health insurance and were almost all undocumented. 
The men were all pretty tough. 
They had to be. 
The police constantly harassed them for loitering, as they made their way each day. 
Slowly, they welcomed me into their community. 
And this was one of the first times that I consciously used my camera as a weapon. 
One day, as the men were organizing to make a day-labor worker center, a young man named Tomás came up to me and asked me will I stay afterwards and photograph him. 
So I agreed. 
As he walked into the middle of the empty dirt lot, a light summer rain started to fall. 
Much to my surprise, he started to take off his clothes. (Laughs) I didn't exactly know what to do. 
He pointed to the sky and said, "Our bodies are all we have." 
He was proud, defiant and vulnerable, all at once. 
And this remains one of my favorite photographs of the past 20 years. 
His words have stuck with me ever since. 
I met Lupe Guzmán around the same time, while she was organizing and fighting the day-labor agencies which were exploiting her and her coworkers. 
She organized small-scale protests, sit-ins and much more. 
She paid a high price for her activism, because the day-labor agencies like Ron's blackballed her and refused to give her work. 
So in order to survive, she started selling elotes, or corn on the cob, on the street, as a street vendor. 
And today, you can still find her selling all types of corn and different candies and stuff. 
Lupe brought me into the inner world of her family and showed me the true impact of migration. 
She introduced me to everyone in her extended family, Gabi, Juan, Conchi, Chava, everyone. 
Her sister Remedios had married Anselmo, whose eight of nine siblings had migrated from Mexico to Chicago in the nineties. 
So many people in her family opened their world to me and shared their stories. 
Families are the heart and lifeblood of the migrant trail. 
When these families migrate, they change and transform societies. 
It's rare to be able to access so intimately the intimate and day-to-day lives of people who, by necessity, are closed to outsiders. 
At the time, Lupe's family lived in the insular world of the Back of the Yards, a tight-knit Chicago neighborhood, which for more than 100 years had been a portal of entry for recent immigrants -- first, from Europe, like my family, and more recently, from Latin America. 
Their world was largely hidden from view. 
And they call the larger, white world outside the neighborhood "Gringolandia." 
You know, like lots of generations moving to the Back of the Yards, the family did the thankless hidden jobs that most people didn't want to do: cleaning office buildings, preparing airline meals in cold factories, meat packing, demolitions. 
It was hard manual labor for low exploitation wages. 
But on weekends, they celebrated together, with backyard barbecues and birthday celebrations, like most working families the world over. 
I became an honorary family member. 
My nickname was "Johnny Canales," after the Tejano TV star. 
I had access to the dominant culture, so I was part family photographer, part social worker and part strange outsider payaso clown, who was there to amuse them. 
One of the most memorable moments of this time was photographing the birth of Lupe's granddaughter, Elizabeth. 
Her two older siblings had crossed across the Sonoran Desert, being carried and pushed in strollers into the United States. 
So at that time, her family allowed me to photograph her birth. 
And it was one of the really coolest things as the nurses placed baby Elizabeth on Gabi's chest. 
She was the family's first American citizen. 
That girl is 17 today. 
And I still remain in close contact with Lupe and much of her family. 
My work is firmly rooted in my own family's history of exile and subsequent rebirth in the United States. 
My father was born in Nazi Germany in 1934. 
Like most assimilated German Jews, my grandparents simply hoped that the troubles of the Third Reich would blow over. 
But in spring of 1939, a small but important event happened to my family. 
My dad needed an appendectomy. 
And because he was Jewish, not one hospital would operate on him. 
The operation was carried out on his kitchen table, on the family's kitchen table. 
Only after understanding the discrimination they faced did my grandparents make the gut-wrenching decision to send their two children on the Kindertransport bound for England. 
My family's survival has informed my deep commitment to telling this migration story in a deep and nuanced way. 
The past and the present are always interconnected. 
The long-standing legacy of the US government's involvement in Latin America is controversial and well-documented. 
The 1954 CIA-backed coup of Árbenz in Guatemala, the Iran-Contra scandal, the School of the Americas, the murder of Archbishop Romero on the steps of a San Salvador church are all examples of this complex history, a history which has led to instability and impunity in Central America. 
Luckily, the history is not unremittingly dark. 
The United States and Mexico took in thousands and millions, actually, of refugees escaping the civil wars of the 70s and 80s. 
But by the time I was documenting the migrant trail in Guatemala in the late 2000s, most Americans had no connection to the increasing levels of violence, impunity and migration in Central America. 
To most US citizens, it might as well have been the Moon. 
Over the years, I slowly pieced together the complicated puzzle that stretched from Central America through Mexico to my backyard in Chicago. 
I hit almost all the border towns -- Brownsville, Reynosa, McAllen, Yuma, Calexico -- recording the increasing militarization of the border. 
Each time I returned, there was more infrastructure, more sensors, more fences, more Border Patrol agents and more high-tech facilities with which to incarcerate the men, women and children who our government detained. 
Post-9/11, it became a huge industry. 
I photographed the massive and historic immigration marches in Chicago, children at detention facilities and the slow percolating rise of anti-immigrant hate groups, including sheriff Joe Arpaio in Arizona. 
I documented the children in detention facilities, deportation flights and a lot of different things. 
I witnessed the rise of the Mexican drug war and the deepening levels of social violence in Central America. 
I came to understand how interconnected all these disparate elements were and how interconnected we all are. 
As photographers, we never really know which particular moment will stay with us or which particular person will be with us. 
The people we photograph become a part of our collective history. 
Jerica Estrada was a young eight-year-old girl whose memory has stayed with me. 
Her father had gone to LA in order to work to support his family. 
And like any dutiful father, he returned home to Guatemala, bearing gifts. 
That weekend, he had presented his eldest son with a motorcycle -- a true luxury. 
As the son was driving the father back home from a family party, a gang member rode up and shot the dad through the back. 
It was a case of mistaken identity, an all too common occurrence in this country. 
But the damage was done. 
The bullet passed through the father and into the son. 
This was not a random act of violence, but one instance of social violence in a region of the world where this has become the norm. 
Impunity thrives when all the state and governmental institutions fail to protect the individual. 
Too often, the result forces people to leave their homes and flee and take great risks in search of safety. 
Jerica's father died en route to the hospital. 
His body had saved his son's life. 
As we arrived to the public hospital, to the gates of the public hospital, I noticed a young girl in a pink striped shirt, screaming. 
Nobody comforted the little girl as she clasped her tiny hands. 
She was the man's youngest daughter, her name was Jerica Estrada. 
She cried and raged, and nobody could do anything, for her father was gone. 
These days, when people ask me why young mothers with four-month-old babies will travel thousands of miles, knowing they will likely be imprisoned in the United States, I remember Jerica, and I think of her and of her pain and of her father who saved his son's life with his own body, and I understand the truly human need to migrate in search of a better life. 
Thank you. 
(Applause) 

[This talk contains mature content] I'm often asked what do I do. 
To which I reply, "I work to end violence against children. 
All violence against every child in every country." 
There's usually a pause. 
Sometimes, depending on the setting, "Whoa, that's a conversation killer." 
And then the questions: "What sort of violence are you talking about?" 
"How much violence is there?" 
"Where is it happening, is it happening here?" 
And when I answer those questions, people tend to be shocked. 
Shocked at the scale of violence, shocked at the nature of violence. 
But I'm always quick to make sure that people aren't left with a sense of doom and gloom. 
I believe we have an unprecedented historical opportunity in this generation to end violence against children. 
There's a nascent movement building around this. 
Governments, national governments, city governments, provinces and others are joining that movement. 
And when we succeed -- and it will take all of us -- we will change the course of human history. 
What do I mean by violence against children? 
I mean all of the physical violence, sexual, psychological and emotional violence that happens to children at home, at school, online and in their communities. 
We work with partners right across the world and from those partners, we hear disturbing stories of individual children. 
For example, Sarah, age 10. 
Raped repeatedly by her stepfather and threatened with violence if she tells anyone. 
Faisal, hit across the knuckles at school with a cable, shamed and called a donkey, made to stand outside in the cold when he gets the answers wrong. 
And from the partners we work with to make the internet safer for children, we hear stories like that of Angelika. 
Twelve years old, and forced to commit sexual acts on her uncle, which are live-streamed to paying adults the other side of the world. 
One in 10 girls experiences sexual abuse before the age of 20. 
Half of children live in countries where corporal punishment has not been fully prohibited. 
And last year alone, in the US, 45 million reports were made of images and videos of violent and sexual abuse of children online. 
Twice the number the year before. 
Now these forms of violence and other forms of violence roll up into some truly staggering numbers. 
One billion children globally every year who experience some kind of violence. 
That's one in two children. 
This is a universal issue. 
So what gives me optimism? 
Let me talk about Sweden and Uganda. 
Probably about as different as two countries you might imagine. 
If you speak to an economist, they might tell you that Sweden has a per capita average income of around 50,000 dollars a year. 
In Uganda, it's 2,000 dollars. 
A historian might tell you Sweden hasn't been in a national conflict for about 200 years. 
Uganda is still struggling with an insurgency in the north of the country. 
A musician might tell you that Uganda, the national anthem, "Oh Uganda, Land of Beauty," is one of the shortest in the world. 
In fact, so short, it's often played more than once. 
I believe Swedes play theirs and sing theirs for a little longer. 
But more seriously, Sweden and Uganda have made a commitment, they have a common bond and shared purpose, a commitment to end violence against children, and they are taking action to try and get their countries on a pathway to zero violence against children by 2030. 
And many other countries, cities and states are joining them, all over the world. 
But what does it really mean, what does it mean in practice? 
When they make that commitment, what do they do? 
It means high-level political commitment and leadership. 
Enacting and implementing legislation. 
And launching initiatives, changing policy, starting a national conversation that begins to raise awareness on a journey to changing attitudes and making it socially unacceptable to have any violence and abuse of children in a country. 
It means recognizing that violence against children cuts across many sectors, and therefore the response, the answer, has to be a systems approach. 
You can't just do one piece of it. 
It requires multiple agencies within and beyond government. 
It requires faith groups, the private sector, media, academia, civil society organizations and others. 
And it requires drawing on what the best practice and the best evidence globally tells us, but using national-level data to shine a light on the often hidden story of violence in any given country. 
And using that data to inform the national response, but also using it to measure and track progress. 
And share what's working, being honest about when things aren't working. 
And sharing inspiration when we see success and violence declining. 
But can we really do this on a global scale? 
One billion children a year experiencing violence. 
I think we can. 
In 2015, 193 world leaders committed their countries to end violence, abuse and neglect of children by 2030. 
Violence against children undermines all the other investments in them: in their health, in their education. 
Often with multi-year, sometimes lifelong and intergenerational consequences and transmission. 
But it's not just about international agreements and governments. 
They really matter. 
I think something's also changing more fundamentally, and we as societies around the world are finally calling out unacceptable behaviors which for too long have been tolerated. 
Think of the #MeToo movement, and how sector after sector, industry after industry, calling out perpetrators, bringing and holding them to account. 
It's a journey, but we've embarked upon it. 
Look at what's happened in the aid industry. 
Following some abuses of power, the aid industry is now taking very seriously the safeguarding of children across the world. 
But maybe even more than that. 
Children and young people themselves, part aided by technology, but they have a voice now that they may not, I don't think, have had before. 
And they are using that voice, not just to advocate for the situation they see around them or what they know needs to improve, but to be part of the solutions of things that actually inform and affect their lives. 
Think of those young activists who speak out against female genital mutilation, child marriage, cyber bullying, safe schools, harming conflict -- the list goes on and on. 
Those children really matter. 
So we have political leadership, we have youth activism, we have evidence-based solutions, we have public awareness growing -- we're on that pathway, beginning that journey to get to zero by 2030. 
But what are those solutions? 
Three years ago, in 2016, 10 global institutions came together and aligned behind a framework which is a comprehensive, step-by-step approach to ending violence against children. 
It's called INSPIRE. 
It looks at the need for the relevant legislation, addressing social norms, parent and caregiver support, responses for children who have experienced violence and abuse. 
And safe schools, so children can be in a learning environment where they thrive. 
In Uganda, four years ago, an eight-year-old girl could be married to a 30-year-old man. 
That can no longer happen. 
In 2016, the Children Act made that illegal and set the minimum age of marriage at 18. 
That's the I of INSPIRE: enact and implement legislation. 
Cambodia is rolling out parental support, parent and caregiver support across the country, so parents are equipped to raise their children and to have discipline in a nonviolent way in the home. 
That's the P of INSPIRE, parent and caregiver support. 
In the Philippines, there are 100 centers set up to protect women and children nationwide. 
Women and children who are either at high risk of abuse and violence or have experienced violence. 
That's the R of INSPIRE, response and support services. 
And in Uganda, a safe schools toolkit has been rolled out now to half of teachers in Uganda, equipping them to control a class with nonviolent discipline. 
That's the E of INSPIRE, education and life skills. 
That's just some bits within some of the INSPIRE framework. 
But more and more countries are committing to implement it, adapt it locally, inform it with the relevant data, put a plan together, work across sectors, and begin that journey to zero. 
Canada, Mexico, United Arab Emirates, Tanzania -- I mentioned Sweden and Uganda already -- Japan, the Philippines, Indonesia, more and more countries, and now cities, too. 
And right here in Scotland, University of Edinburgh is establishing a learning lab that's going to track the journey that cities in Scotland and the Philippines and Colombia go on together. 
See what works in a city, take something that's being prepared for implementation at a nationwide level and bring it down to the city level, where we believe that we can actually make probably faster and demonstrable progress in a shorter space of time. 
And when we do that, that success will be shared through the learning lab and beyond at Edinburgh University. 
Ending violence is the right thing to do, it's a smart investment to make, we have evidence-based solutions, and we have the beginnings of a journey. 
But what would happen if we actually end violence against children? 
Let's just imagine for a moment. 
First of all, think of the children I mentioned. 
Sarah would no longer lie in her bed at night, fearful of the sound of her stepfather's footsteps coming up the stairs. 
Faisal would go to school and he would thrive. 
He would no longer fear being at school and being bullied and hit and ashamed by the teachers. 
And Angelika and those like her would no longer be something, a commodity brought online for the enjoyment of adults thousands of miles away. 
But then multiply the social, the economic, the cultural benefits of that. 
Multiply those by every family, every community, village, town, city, country and suddenly, you've got a new normal emerging. 
A generation would grow up without having experienced violence. 
It will take us all. 
But we do have an unprecedented opportunity to try, and I believe we also, as adults, have a responsibility to do this. 
And then when we're all asked, "What do you do?" 
each and every one of us can say, "I'm changing the course of human history. 
I'm doing my bit to end violence against children." 
Let's do this and do it now. 
Thank you. 
(Applause) 

I'm here to talk to you about something important that may be new to you. 
The governments of the world are about to conduct an unintentional experiment on our climate. 
In 2020, new rules will require ships to lower their sulfur emissions by scrubbing their dirty exhaust or switching to cleaner fuels. 
For human health, this is really good, but sulfur particles in the emission of ships also have an effect on clouds. 
This is a satellite image of marine clouds off the Pacific West Coast of the United States. 
The streaks in the clouds are created by the exhaust from ships. 
Ships' emissions include both greenhouse gases, which trap heat over long periods of time, and particulates like sulfates that mix with clouds and temporarily make them brighter. 
Brighter clouds reflect more sunlight back to space, cooling the climate. 
So in fact, humans are currently running two unintentional experiments on our climate. 
In the first one, we're increasing the concentration of greenhouse gases and gradually warming the earth system. 
This works something like a fever in the human body. 
If the fever remains low, its effects are mild, but as the fever rises, damage grows more severe and eventually devastating. 
We're seeing a little of this now. 
In our other experiment, we're planning to remove a layer of particles that brighten clouds and shield us from some of this warming. 
The effect is strongest in ocean clouds like these, and scientists expect the reduction of sulfur emissions from ships next year to produce a measurable increase in global warming. 
Bit of a shocker? 
In fact, most emissions contain sulfates that brighten clouds: coal, diesel exhaust, forest fires. 
Scientists estimate that the total cooling effect from emission particles, which they call aerosols when they're in the climate, may be as much as all of the warming we've experienced up until now. 
There's a lot of uncertainty around this effect, and it's one of the major reasons why we have difficulty predicting climate, but this is cooling that we'll lose as emissions fall. 
So to be clear, humans are currently cooling the planet by dispersing particles into the atmosphere at massive scale. 
We just don't know how much, and we're doing it accidentally. 
That's worrying, but it could mean that we have a fast-acting way to reduce warming, emergency medicine for our climate fever if we needed it, and it's a medicine with origins in nature. 
This is a NASA simulation of earth's atmosphere, showing clouds and particles moving over the planet. 
The brightness is the Sun's light reflecting from particles in clouds, and this reflective shield is one of the primary ways that nature keeps the planet cool enough for humans and all of the life that we know. 
In 2015, scientists assessed possibilities for rapidly cooling climate. 
They discounted things like mirrors in space, ping-pong balls in the ocean, plastic sheets on the Arctic, and they found that the most viable approaches involved slightly increasing this atmospheric reflectivity. 
In fact, it's possible that reflecting just one or two percent more sunlight from the atmosphere could offset two degrees Celsius or more of warming. 
Now, I'm a technology executive, not a scientist. 
About a decade ago, concerned about climate, I started to talk with scientists about potential countermeasures to warming. 
These conversations grew into collaborations that became the Marine Cloud Brightening Project, which I'll talk about momentarily, and the nonprofit policy organization SilverLining, where I am today. 
I work with politicians, researchers, members of the tech industry and others to talk about some of these ideas. 
Early on, I met British atmospheric scientist John Latham, who proposed cooling the climate the way that the ships do, but with a natural source of particles: sea-salt mist from seawater sprayed from ships into areas of susceptible clouds over the ocean. 
The approach became known by the name I gave it then, "marine cloud brightening." 
Early modeling studies suggested that by deploying marine cloud brightening in just 10 to 20 percent of susceptible ocean clouds, it might be possible to offset as much as two degrees Celsius's warming. 
It might even be possible to brighten clouds in local regions to reduce the impacts caused by warming ocean surface temperatures. 
For example, regions such as the Gulf Atlantic might be cooled in the months before a hurricane season to reduce the force of storms. 
Or, it might be possible to cool waters flowing onto coral reefs overwhelmed by heat stress, like Australia's Great Barrier Reef. 
But these ideas are only theoretical, and brightening marine clouds is not the only way to increase the reflection of the sunlight from the atmosphere. 
Another occurs when large volcanoes release material with enough force to reach the upper layer of the atmosphere, the stratosphere. 
When Mount Pinatubo erupted in 1991, it released material into the stratosphere, including sulfates that mix with the atmosphere to reflect sunlight. 
This material remained and circulated around the planet. 
It was enough to cool the climate by over half a degree Celsius for about two years. 
This cooling led to a striking increase in Arctic ice cover in 1992, which dropped in subsequent years as the particles fell back to earth. 
But the volcanic phenomenon led Nobel Prize winner Paul Crutzen to propose the idea that dispersing particles into the stratosphere in a controlled way might be a way to counter global warming. 
Now, this has risks that we don't understand, including things like heating up the stratosphere or damage to the ozone layer. 
Scientists think that there could be safe approaches to this, but is this really where we are? 
Is this really worth considering? 
This is a simulation from the US National Center for Atmospheric Research global climate model showing, earth surface temperatures through 2100. 
The globe on the left visualizes our current trajectory, and on the right, a world where particles are introduced into the stratosphere gradually in 2020, and maintained through 2100. 
Intervention keeps surface temperatures near those of today, while without it, temperatures rise well over three degrees. 
This could be the difference between a safe and an unsafe world. 
So, if there's even a chance that this could be close to reality, is this something we should consider seriously? 
Today, there are no capabilities, and scientific knowledge is extremely limited. 
We don't know whether these types of interventions are even feasible, or how to characterize their risks. 
Researchers hope to explore some basic questions that might help us know whether or not these might be real options or whether we should rule them out. 
It requires multiple ways of studying the climate system, including computer models to forecast changes, analytic techniques like machine learning, and many types of observations. 
And though it's controversial, it's also critical that researchers develop core technologies and perform small-scale, real-world experiments. 
There are two research programs proposing experiments like this. 
At Harvard, the SCoPEx experiment would release very small amounts of sulfates, calcium carbonate and water into the stratosphere with a balloon, to study chemistry and physics effects. 
How much material? 
Less than the amount released in one minute of flight from a commercial aircraft. 
So this is definitely not dangerous, and it may not even be scary. 
At the University of Washington, scientists hope to spray a fine mist of salt water into clouds in a series of land and ocean tests. 
If those are successful, this would culminate in experiments to measurably brighten an area of clouds over the ocean. 
The marine cloud brightening effort is the first to develop any technology for generating aerosols for atmospheric sunlight reflection in this way. 
It requires producing very tiny particles -- think about the mist that comes out of an asthma inhaler -- at massive scale -- so think of looking up at a cloud. 
It's a tricky engineering problem. 
So this one nozzle they developed generates three trillion particles per second, 80 nanometers in size, from very corrosive saltwater. 
It was developed by a team of retired engineers in Silicon Valley -- here they are -- working full-time for six years, without pay, for their grandchildren. 
It will take a few million dollars and another year or two to develop the full spray system they need to do these experiments. 
In other parts of the world, research efforts are emerging, including small modeling programs at Beijing Normal University in China, the Indian Institute of Science, a proposed center for climate repair at Cambridge University in the UK and the DECIMALS Fund, which sponsors researchers in global South countries to study the potential impacts of these sunlight interventions in their part of the world. 
But all of these programs, including the experimental ones, lack significant funding. 
And understanding these interventions is a hard problem. 
The earth is a vast, complex system and we need major investments in climate models, observations and basic science to be able to predict climate much better than we can today and manage both our accidental and any intentional interventions. 
And it could be urgent. 
Recent scientific reports predict that in the next few decades, earth's fever is on a path to devastation: extreme heat and fires, major loss of ocean life, collapse of Arctic ice, displacement and suffering for hundreds of millions of people. 
The fever could even reach tipping points where warming takes over and human efforts are no longer enough to counter accelerating changes in natural systems. 
To prevent this circumstance, the UN's International Panel on Climate Change predicts that we need to stop and even reverse emissions by 2050. 
How? We have to quickly and radically transform major economic sectors, including energy, construction, agriculture, transportation and others. 
And it is imperative that we do this as fast as we can. 
But our fever is now so high that climate experts say we also have to remove massive quantities of CO2 from the atmosphere, possibly 10 times all of the world's annual emissions, in ways that aren't proven yet. 
Right now, we have slow-moving solutions to a fast-moving problem. 
Even with the most optimistic assumptions, our exposure to risk in the next 10 to 30 years is unacceptably high, in my opinion. 
Could interventions like these provide fast-acting medicine if we need it to reduce the earth's fever while we address its underlying causes? 
There are real concerns about this idea. 
Some people are very worried that even researching these interventions could provide an excuse to delay efforts to reduce emissions. 
This is also known as a moral hazard. 
But, like most medicines, interventions are more dangerous the more that you do, so research actually tends to draw out the fact that we absolutely, positively cannot continue to fill up the atmosphere with greenhouse gases, that these kinds of alternatives are risky and if we were to use them, we would need to use as little as possible. 
But even so, could we ever learn enough about these interventions to manage the risk? 
Who would make decisions about when and how to intervene? 
What if some people are worse off, or they just think they are? 
These are really hard problems. 
But what really worries me is that as climate impacts worsen, leaders will be called on to respond by any means available. 
I for one don't want them to act without real information and much better options. 
Scientists think it will take a decade of research just to assess these interventions, before we ever were to develop or use them. 
Yet today, the global level of investment in these interventions is effectively zero. 
So, we need to move quickly if we want policymakers to have real information on this kind of emergency medicine. 
There is hope! 
The world has solved these kinds of problems before. 
In the 1970s, we identified an existential threat to our protective ozone layer. 
In the 1980s, scientists, politicians and industry came together in a solution to replace the chemicals causing the problem. 
They achieved this with the only legally binding environmental agreement signed by all countries in the world, the Montreal Protocol. 
Still in force today, it has resulted in a recovery of the ozone layer and is the most successful environmental protection effort in human history. 
We have a far greater threat now, but we do have the ability to develop and agree on solutions to protect people and restore our climate to health. 
This could mean that to remain safe, we reflect sunlight for a few decades, while we green our industries and remove CO2. 
It definitely means we must work now to understand our options for this kind of emergency medicine. 
Thank you, (Applause) 

I was born in 1993 in the northern part of North Korea, in a town called Hyesan, which is on the border with China. 
I had loving parents and one older sister. 
Before I was even 10 years old, my father was sent to a labor camp for engaging in illegal trading. 
Now, by "illegal trading" -- he was selling clogs, sugar, rice and later copper to feed us. 
In 2007, my sister and I decided to escape. 
She was 16 years old, and I was 13 years old. 
I need you to understand what the word "escape" means in the context of North Korea. 
We were all starving, and hunger means death in North Korea. 
So it was the only option for us. 
I didn't even understand the concept of escape, but I could see the lights from China at night, and I wondered if I go where the light is, I might be able to find a bowl of rice. 
It's not like we had a grand plan or maps. 
We did not know anything about what was going to happen. 
Imagine your apartment building caught fire. 
I mean, what would you do? 
Would you stay there to be burned, or would you jump off out of the window and see what happens? 
That's what we did. 
We jumped out of the house instead of the fire. 
North Korea is unimaginable. 
It's very hard for me when people ask me what it feels like to live there. 
To be honest, I tell you: you can't even imagine it. 
The words in any language can't describe, because it's a totally different planet, as you cannot imagine your life on Mars right now. 
For example, the word "love" has only one meaning: love for the Dear Leader. 
There's no concept of romantic love in North Korea. 
And if you don't know the words, that means you don't understand the concept, and therefore, you don't even realize that concept is even a possibility. 
Let me give you another example. 
Growing up in North Korea, we truly believed that our Dear Leader is an almighty god who can even read my thoughts. 
I was even afraid to think in North Korea. 
We are told that he's starving for us, and he's working tirelessly for us, and my heart just broke for him. 
When I escaped to South Korea, people told me that he was actually a dictator, he had cars, many, many resorts, and he had an ultraluxurious life. 
And then I remember looking at a picture of him, realizing for the first time that he is the largest guy in the picture. 
(Laughter) And it hit me. 
Finally, I realized he wasn't starving. 
But I was never able to see that before, until someone told me that he was fat. 
(Laughter) Really, someone had to teach me that he was fat. 
If you have never practiced critical thinking, then you simply see what you're told to see. 
The biggest question also people ask me is: "Why is there no revolution inside North Korea? 
Are we dumb? 
Why is there no revolution for 70 years of this oppression?" 
And I say: If you don't know you're a slave, if you don't know you're isolated or oppressed, how do you fight to be free? 
I mean, if you know you're isolated, that means you are not isolated. 
Not knowing is the true definition of isolation, and that's why I never knew I was isolated when I was in North Korea. 
I literally thought I was in the center of the universe. 
So here is my idea worth spreading: a lot of people think humans inherently know what is right and wrong, the difference between justice and injustice, what we deserve and we don't deserve. 
I tell them: BS. 
(Laughter) (Applause) Everything, everything must be taught, including compassion. 
If I see someone dying on the street right now, I will do anything to save that person. 
But when I was in North Korea, I saw people dying and dead on the streets. 
I felt nothing. 
Not because I'm a psychopath, but because I never learned the concept of compassion. 
Only, I felt compassion, empathy and sympathy in my heart after I learned the word "compassion" and the concept, and I feel them now. 
Now I live in the United States as a free person. 
(Applause) Thank you. 
(Applause) And recently, the leader of the free country, our President Trump, met with my former god. 
And he decided human rights is not important enough to include in his agendas, and he did not talk about it. 
And it scares me. 
We live in a world right now where a dictator can be praised for executing his uncle, for killing his half brother, killing thousands of North Koreans. 
And that was worthy of praise. 
And also it made me think: perhaps we all need to be taught something new about freedom now. 
Freedom is fragile. 
I don't want to alarm you, but it is. 
It only took three generations to make North Korea into George Orwell's "1984." 
It took only three generations. 
If we don't fight for human rights for the people who are oppressed right now who don't have a voice, as free people here, who will fight for us when we are not free? 
Machines? Animals? I don't know. 
I think it's wonderful that we care about climate change, animal rights, gender equality, all of these things. 
The fact that we care about animals' rights, that means that's how beautiful our heart is, that we care about someone who cannot speak for themselves. 
And North Koreans right now cannot speak for themselves. 
They don't have internet in the 21st century. 
We don't have electricity, and it is the darkest place on earth right now. 
Now I want to say something to my fellow North Koreans who are living in that darkness. 
They might not believe this, but I want to tell them that an alternative life is possible. 
Be free. 
From my experience, literally anything is possible. 
I was bought, I was sold as a slave. 
But now I'm here, and that is why I believe in miracles. 
The one thing that I learned from history is that nothing is forever in this world. 
And that is why we have every reason to be hopeful. 
Thank you. 
(Applause) 

When I was young, I wanted to be on TV: the lights, the cameras, the makeup, the glamorous life. 
And from my vantage point, just outside of a military base in Lawton, Oklahoma, I didn't make the distinction between TV reporter or actor. 
It was all the same to me. 
It was either, "Reporting live from Berlin" or "I shall attend her here and woo her with such spirit when she comes." 
(Laughter) It was all special, it was all the spotlight, and I just knew that it was for me. 
But somewhere along my journey, life happened. 
Ah, much better. 
(Applause) I have a disease called vitiligo. 
It started early in my career. 
It's an autoimmune disorder. 
It's where it looks like your skin is getting white patches, but it's actually void of color. 
It affects all ethnicities, it affects all ages, all genders, it's not contagious, it's not life-threatening, but it is mental warfare. 
It's tough. 
Now, I was diagnosed with this disease when I was working on "Eyewitness News" in New York City. 
I was in the biggest city in the country, I was on their flagship station and I was on their top-rated 5pm newscast. 
And the doctor looked me right in the eye and said, "You have a disease called vitiligo. 
It's a skin disorder where you lose your pigment. 
There is no cure, but there a-la-la-la-la". 
Charlie Brown's teacher. 
(Laughter) He said there is no cure. All I heard was, "My career is over." 
But I just couldn't give up. 
I couldn't quit, because we put too much into this. 
And by "we" I mean Mr. Moss, who sent me to speech and drama club instead of to detention, or my sister who paid part of my college expenses, or my mom, who simply gave me everything. 
I would not quit. 
So I decided to just put on makeup and keep it moving. 
I had to wear makeup anyway. It's TV, baby, right? 
I just put on a little more makeup, and everything's cool. 
And that actually went very well for years. 
I went from being a reporter in New York City to being a morning show anchor in Detroit, the Motor City. 
And as the disease got worse, I just put on more makeup. 
It was easy. 
Except for my hands. 
See, this disease is progressive and ever-changing. 
That means it comes and goes. 
At one point, for about a year and a half, my face was completely white. 
Yeah, it trips me out too. 
(Laughter) Yeah. 
And then, with a little help, some of the pigment came back, but living through this process was like two sides of a coin. 
When I'm at work and I'm wearing the makeup or wearing the makeup outside, I'm the TV guy. 
"Hey, how you doing everybody? Great." 
At home without the makeup, I'd take it off and it was like being a leper. 
The stares, constantly staring at me, the comments under their breath. 
Some people refused to shake my hand. 
Some people moved to the other side of the sidewalk, moved to the other side of the elevator. 
I felt like they were moving to the other side of life. 
It was tough, and those were some tough years. 
And honestly, sometimes I just had to shelter in place. 
You know what I mean? 
Kind of just stay at home till I get my mind right. 
But then I'd put my blinders back on, I'd get back out there, do my thing, but in the process of doing that, I developed this -- angry, grumpy demeanor. 
Anger is an easy go-to, and people would leave me alone, but it just wasn't me. 
It wasn't me. 
I was allowing this disease to turn me into this angry, grumpy, spotted guy. 
It just wasn't me. 
So I had to change. 
I knew I could not change other people. 
People are going to react and do what they gonna do. 
But there was a cold hard reality as well. 
I was the one that was showing anger, sadness and isolating myself. 
It was actually a choice. 
I was walking out the door every day expecting the world to react with negativity, so I just gave them that mean face first. 
If I wanted change, the change had to start with me. 
So I came up with a plan. 
Two-parter, not that deep. 
Number one: I would just let people stare, drink it in, stare all you want, and not react. 
Because the truth is when I got this disease, I was all up in the mirror staring at every new spot trying to figure out what is going on. 
So I needed to let other people have that same opportunity to get that visual understanding. 
Number two: I would react with positivity, and that was simply a smile, or, at the very least, a nonjudgmental, kind face. 
Simple plan. 
But it turned out to be more difficult than I thought. 
But over time, things started to go OK. 
Like this one time, I'm at the store and this dude is like staring at me, like burning a hole in the side of my head. 
I'm shopping, he's staring at me, I'm going to the checkout, he's staring at me, I'm checking out, he's on the other line checking out, he's staring at me, we go to the exit, he's still staring at me, so I see he's staring and finally I turn to him and I go, "Hey buddy, what's up!" 
And he goes ... 
(Mumbles nervously) "Hi!" 
(Laughter) Awkward. 
So to relieve the tension, I say, "It's just a skin disorder. 
It's not contagious, it's not life-threatening, it just makes me look a little different." 
I end up talking to that guy for like five minutes. 
It was kind of cool, right? 
And at the end of our conversation, he says, "You know, if you didn't have 'vitilargo'" -- it's actually vitiligo, but he was trying, so -- (Laughter) "if you didn't have vitilargo, you'd look just like that guy on TV." 
(Laughter) And I was like, "Haha, yeah, I get that, I get that, yeah." 
(Laughter) So things were going OK. 
I was having more good exchanges than bad, until that day. 
I had a little time before work so I like to stop by the park to watch the kids play. 
They're funny. 
So I got a little too close, this little girl wasn't paying attention, she's about two or three years old, she's running, she runs directly into my leg and falls down, pretty hard. 
I thought she hurt herself, so I reach out to try and help the little girl and she looks at my vitiligo and she screams! 
Now kids are pure honesty. 
She's like two or three. 
This little girl, she wasn't trying to be mean. 
She didn't have any malice in her heart. 
This little girl was afraid. 
She was just afraid. 
I didn't know what to do. 
I just took a step back and put my hands by my side. 
I stayed in the house for two weeks and three days on that one. 
It took me a second to get my mind around the fact that I scare small children. 
And that was something that I could not smile away. 
But I jumped back on my plan and just put on my blinders, started going back out. 
Two months later, I'm in a grocery store reaching on the bottom shelf, and I hear a little voice go, "You've got a boo-boo?" 
It's like a two-year-old, three-year-old, same age, little girl, but she's not crying, so I kneel down in front of her and I don't speak two-year-old so I look up at the mom, and I say, "What did she say?" 
And she says, "She thinks you have a boo-boo." 
So I go, "No, I don't have a boo-boo, no, not at all." 
And the little girl says, "Duh-duh-hoy?" 
And so I look to mom for the translation, and she says, "She thinks you're hurt." 
And I say, "No, sweetie, I'm not hurt at all, I'm fine." 
And the little girl reaches out with that little hand and touches my face. 
She's trying to rub the chocolate into the vanilla or whatever she was doing. 
It was amazing! 
It was awesome. 
Because she thought she knew what it was, she was giving me everything I wanted: kindness, compassion. 
And with the touch of that little hand, she healed a grown man's pain. 
Yee-ha. 
Healed. 
I smiled for a long time on that one. 
Positivity is something worth fighting for, and the fight is not with others -- it's internal. 
If you want to make positive changes in your life, you have to consistently be positive. 
My blood type is actually B positive. 
(Laughter) I know, corny TV guy dad joke, my daughter hates it, but I don't care! 
Be positive! 
(Laughs) A 14-year-old boy years ago -- this kid had vitiligo -- he asked me to show my face on television. 
I wasn't going to do it, we've been over this, I thought I was going to lose my job, but the kid convinced me by saying, "If you show people what you look like and explain this to them, maybe they will treat me differently." 
Boom! Blinders off. 
I did a TV report, got an overwhelming response. 
So I didn't know what to do. 
I took the attention and focused it back on the kid and other people that have vitiligo. 
I started a support group. 
Pretty soon, we noticed "VITFriends" and "V-Strong" support groups all over the country. 
In 2016, we all came together and celebrated World Vitiligo Day. 
This past June 25, we had over 300 people, all in celebration of our annual event. 
It was amazing. 
(Applause) Thanks. 
Now, I'm not going to lie to you and say it was quick or easy for me to find a positive place living with this disease, but I found it. 
But I also got much more. 
I became a better man, the man I always wanted to be, the kind of guy who can stand up in front of a room full of strangers and tell some of the toughest stories in his life and end it all with a smile, and find happiness in the fact that you all just smiled back. 
Thank you. 
(Applause) 

I spent the past three years talking to some of the worst people on the internet. 
Now, if you've been online recently, you may have noticed that there's a lot of toxic garbage out there: racist memes, misogynist propaganda, viral misinformation. 
So I wanted to know who was making this stuff. 
I wanted to understand how they were spreading it. 
Ultimately, I wanted to know what kind of impact it might be having on our society. 
So in 2016, I started tracing some of these memes back to their source, back to the people who were making them or who were making them go viral. 
I'd approach those people and say, "Hey, I'm a journalist. Can I come watch you do what you do?" 
Now, often the response would be, "Why in hell would I want to talk to some low-t soy-boy Brooklyn globalist Jew cuck who's in cahoots with the Democrat Party?" 
(Laughter) To which my response would be, "Look, man, that's only 57 percent true." 
(Laughter) But often I got the opposite response. 
"Yeah, sure, come on by." 
So that's how I ended up in the living room of a social media propagandist in Southern California. 
He was a married white guy in his late 30s. 
He had a table in front of him with a mug of coffee, a laptop for tweeting, a phone for texting and an iPad for livestreaming to Periscope and YouTube. 
That was it. 
And yet, with those tools, he was able to propel his fringe, noxious talking points into the heart of the American conversation. 
For example, one of the days I was there, a bomb had just exploded in New York, and the guy accused of planting the bomb had a Muslim-sounding name. 
Now, to the propagandist in California, this seemed like an opportunity, because one of the things he wanted was for the US to cut off almost all immigration, especially from Muslim-majority countries. 
So he started livestreaming, getting his followers worked up into a frenzy about how the open borders agenda was going to kill us all and asking them to tweet about this, and use specific hashtags, trying to get those hashtags trending. 
And tweet they did -- hundreds and hundreds of tweets, a lot of them featuring images like this one. 
So that's George Soros. 
He's a Hungarian billionaire and philanthropist, and in the minds of some conspiracists online, George Soros is like a globalist bogeyman, one of a few elites who is secretly manipulating all of global affairs. 
Now, just to pause here: if this idea sounds familiar to you, that there are a few elites who control the world and a lot of them happen to be rich Jews, that's because it is one of the most anti-Semitic tropes in existence. 
I should also mention that the guy in New York who planted that bomb, he was an American citizen. 
So whatever else was going on there, immigration was not the main issue. 
And the propagandist in California, he understood all this. 
He was a well-read guy. He was actually a lawyer. 
He knew the underlying facts, but he also knew that facts do not drive conversation online. 
What drives conversation online is emotion. 
See, the original premise of social media was that it was going to bring us all together, make the world more open and tolerant and fair ... 
And it did some of that. 
But the social media algorithms have never been built to distinguish between what's true or false, what's good or bad for society, what's prosocial and what's antisocial. 
That's just not what those algorithms do. 
A lot of what they do is measure engagement: clicks, comments, shares, retweets, that kind of thing. 
And if you want your content to get engagement, it has to spark emotion, specifically, what behavioral scientists call "high-arousal emotion." 
Now, "high arousal" doesn't only mean sexual arousal, although it's the internet, obviously that works. 
It means anything, positive or negative, that gets people's hearts pumping. 
So I would sit with these propagandists, not just the guy in California, but dozens of them, and I would watch as they did this again and again successfully, not because they were Russian hackers, not because they were tech prodigies, not because they had unique political insights -- just because they understood how social media worked, and they were willing to exploit it to their advantage. 
Now, at first I was able to tell myself this was a fringe phenomenon, something that was relegated to the internet. 
But there's really no separation anymore between the internet and everything else. 
This is an ad that ran on multiple TV stations during the 2018 congressional elections, alleging with very little evidence that one of the candidates was in the pocket of international manipulator George Soros, who is awkwardly photoshopped here next to stacks of cash. 
This is a tweet from the President of the United States, alleging, again with no evidence, that American politics is being manipulated by George Soros. 
This stuff that once seemed so shocking and marginal and, frankly, just ignorable, it's now so normalized that we hardly even notice it. 
So I spent about three years in this world. 
I talked to a lot of people. 
Some of them seemed to have no core beliefs at all. 
They just seemed to be betting, perfectly rationally, that if they wanted to make some money online or get some attention online, they should just be as outrageous as possible. 
But I talked to other people who were true ideologues. 
And to be clear, their ideology was not traditional conservatism. 
These were people who wanted to revoke female suffrage. 
These were people who wanted to go back to racial segregation. 
Some of them wanted to do away with democracy altogether. 
Now, obviously these people were not born believing these things. 
They didn't pick them up in elementary school. 
A lot of them, before they went down some internet rabbit hole, they had been libertarian or they had been socialist or they had been something else entirely. 
So what was going on? 
Well, I can't generalize about every case, but a lot of the people I spoke to, they seem to have a combination of a high IQ and a low EQ. 
They seem to take comfort in anonymous, online spaces rather than connecting in the real world. 
So often they would retreat to these message boards or these subreddits, where their worst impulses would be magnified. 
They might start out saying something just as a sick joke, and then they would get so much positive reinforcement for that joke, so many meaningless "internet points," as they called it, that they might start believing their own joke. 
I talked a lot with one young woman who grew up in New Jersey, and then after high school, she moved to a new place and suddenly she just felt alienated and cut off and started retreating into her phone. 
She found some of these spaces on the internet where people would post the most shocking, heinous things. 
And she found this stuff really off-putting but also kind of engrossing, kind of like she couldn't look away from it. 
She started interacting with people in these online spaces, and they made her feel smart, they made her feel validated. 
She started feeling a sense of community, started wondering if maybe some of these shocking memes might actually contain a kernel of truth. 
A few months later, she was in a car with some of her new internet friends headed to Charlottesville, Virginia, to march with torches in the name of the white race. 
She'd gone, in a few months, from Obama supporter to fully radicalized white supremacist. 
Now, in her particular case, she actually was able to find her way out of the cult of white supremacy. 
But a lot of the people I spoke to were not. 
And just to be clear: I was never so convinced that I had to find common ground with every single person I spoke to that I was willing to say, "You know what, man, you're a fascist propagandist, I'm not, whatever, let's just hug it out, all our differences will melt away." 
No, absolutely not. 
But I did become convinced that we cannot just look away from this stuff. 
We have to try to understand it, because only by understanding it can we even start to inoculate ourselves against it. 
In my three years in this world, I got a few nasty phone calls, even some threats, but it wasn't a fraction of what female journalists get on this beat. 
And yeah, I am Jewish, although, weirdly, a lot of the Nazis couldn't tell I was Jewish, which I frankly just found kind of disappointing. 
(Laughter) Seriously, like, your whole job is being a professional anti-Semite. 
Nothing about me is tipping you off at all? 
Nothing? 
(Laughter) This is not a secret. 
My name is Andrew Marantz, I write for "The New Yorker," my personality type is like if a Seinfeld episode was taped at the Park Slope Food Coop. 
Nothing? 
(Laughter) Anyway, look -- ultimately, it would be nice if there were, like, a simple formula: smartphone plus alienated kid equals 12 percent chance of Nazi. 
It's obviously not that simple. 
And in my writing, I'm much more comfortable being descriptive, not prescriptive. 
But this is TED, so let's get practical. 
I want to share a few suggestions of things that citizens of the internet like you and I might be able to do to make things a little bit less toxic. 
So the first one is to be a smart skeptic. 
So, I think there are two kinds of skepticism. 
And I don't want to drown you in technical epistemological information here, but I call them smart and dumb skepticism. 
So, smart skepticism: thinking for yourself, questioning every claim, demanding evidence -- great, that's real skepticism. 
Dumb skepticism: it sounds like skepticism, but it's actually closer to knee-jerk contrarianism. 
Everyone says the earth is round, you say it's flat. 
Everyone says racism is bad, you say, "I dunno, I'm skeptical about that." 
I cannot tell you how many young white men I have spoken to in the last few years who have said, "You know, the media, my teachers, they're all trying to indoctrinate me into believing in male privilege and white privilege, but I don't know about that, man, I don't think so." 
Guys -- contrarian white teens of the world -- look: if you are being a round earth skeptic and a male privilege skeptic and a racism is bad skeptic, you're not being a skeptic, you're being a jerk. 
(Applause) It's great to be independent-minded, we all should be independent-minded, but just be smart about it. 
So this next one is about free speech. 
You will hear smart, accomplished people who will say, "Well, I'm pro-free speech," and they say it in this way that it's like they're settling a debate, when actually, that is the very beginning of any meaningful conversation. 
All the interesting stuff happens after that point. 
OK, you're pro-free speech. What does that mean? 
Does it mean that David Duke and Richard Spencer need to have active Twitter accounts? 
Does it mean that anyone can harass anyone else online for any reason? 
You know, I looked through the entire list of TED speakers this year. 
I didn't find a single round earth skeptic. 
Is that a violation of free speech norms? 
Look, we're all pro-free speech, it's wonderful to be pro-free speech, but if that's all you know how to say again and again, you're standing in the way of a more productive conversation. 
Making decency cool again, so ... 
Great! 
(Applause) Yeah. I don't even need to explain it. 
So in my research, I would go to Reddit or YouTube or Facebook, and I would search for "sharia law" or I would search for "the Holocaust," and you might be able to guess what the algorithms showed me, right? 
"Is sharia law sweeping across the United States?" 
"Did the Holocaust really happen?" 
Dumb skepticism. 
So we've ended up in this bizarre dynamic online, where some people see bigoted propaganda as being edgy or being dangerous and cool, and people see basic truth and human decency as pearl-clutching or virtue-signaling or just boring. 
And the social media algorithms, whether intentionally or not, they have incentivized this, because bigoted propaganda is great for engagement. 
Everyone clicks on it, everyone comments on it, whether they love it or they hate it. 
So the number one thing that has to happen here is social networks need to fix their platforms. 
(Applause) So if you're listening to my voice and you work at a social media company or you invest in one or, I don't know, own one, this tip is for you. 
If you have been optimizing for maximum emotional engagement and maximum emotional engagement turns out to be actively harming the world, it's time to optimize for something else. 
(Applause) But in addition to putting pressure on them to do that and waiting for them and hoping that they'll do that, there's some stuff that the rest of us can do, too. 
So, we can create some better pathways or suggest some better pathways for angsty teens to go down. 
If you see something that you think is really creative and thoughtful and you want to share that thing, you can share that thing, even if it's not flooding you with high arousal emotion. 
Now that is a very small step, I realize, but in the aggregate, this stuff does matter, because these algorithms, as powerful as they are, they are taking their behavioral cues from us. 
So let me leave you with this. 
You know, a few years ago it was really fashionable to say that the internet was a revolutionary tool that was going to bring us all together. 
It's now more fashionable to say that the internet is a huge, irredeemable dumpster fire. 
Neither caricature is really true. 
We know the internet is just too vast and complex to be all good or all bad. 
And the danger with these ways of thinking, whether it's the utopian view that the internet will inevitably save us or the dystopian view that it will inevitably destroy us, either way, we're letting ourselves off the hook. 
There is nothing inevitable about our future. 
The internet is made of people. 
People make decisions at social media companies. 
People make hashtags trend or not trend. 
People make societies progress or regress. 
When we internalize that fact, we can stop waiting for some inevitable future to arrive and actually get to work now. 
You know, we've all been taught that the arc of the moral universe is long but that it bends toward justice. 
Maybe. 
Maybe it will. 
But that has always been an aspiration. 
It is not a guarantee. 
The arc doesn't bend itself. 
It's not bent inevitably by some mysterious force. 
The real truth, which is scarier and also more liberating, is that we bend it. 
Thank you. 
(Applause) 

I've been intrigued by this question of whether we could evolve or develop a sixth sense -- a sense that would give us seamless access and easy access to meta-information or information that may exist somewhere that may be relevant to help us make the right decision about whatever it is that we're coming across. 
And some of you may argue, "Well, don't today's cell phones do that already?" 
But I would say no. 
When you meet someone here at TED -- and this is the top networking place, of course, of the year -- you don't shake somebody's hand and then say, "Can you hold on for a moment while I take out my phone and Google you?" 
Or when you go to the supermarket and you're standing there in that huge aisle of different types of toilet papers, you don't take out your cell phone, and open a browser, and go to a website to try to decide which of these different toilet papers is the most ecologically responsible purchase to make. 
So we don't really have easy access to all this relevant information that can just help us make optimal decisions about what to do next and what actions to take. 
And so my research group at the Media Lab has been developing a series of inventions to give us access to this information in a sort of easy way, without requiring that the user changes any of their behavior. 
And I'm here to unveil our latest effort, and most successful effort so far, which is still very much a work in process. 
I'm actually wearing the device right now and we've sort of cobbled it together with components that are off the shelf -- and that, by the way, only cost 350 dollars at this point in time. 
I'm wearing a camera, just a simple web cam, a portable, battery-powered projection system with a little mirror. 
These components communicate to my cell phone in my pocket which acts as the communication and computation device. 
And in the video here we see my student Pranav Mistry, who's really the genius who's been implementing and designing this whole system. 
And we see how this system lets him walk up to any surface and start using his hands to interact with the information that is projected in front of him. 
The system tracks the four significant fingers. 
In this case, he's wearing simple marker caps that you may recognize. 
But if you want a more stylish version, you could also paint your nails in different colors. 
And the camera basically tracks these four fingers and recognizes any gestures that he's making so he can just go to, for example, a map of Long Beach, zoom in and out, etc. 
The system also recognizes iconic gestures such as the "take a picture" gesture, and then takes a picture of whatever is in front of you. 
And when he then walks back to the Media Lab, he can just go up to any wall and project all the pictures that he's taken, sort through them and organize them, and re-size them, etc., again using all natural gestures. 
So, some of you most likely were here two years ago and saw the demo by Jeff Han, or some of you may think, "Well, doesn't this look like the Microsoft Surface Table?" 
And yes, you also interact using natural gestures, both hands, etc. 
But the difference here is that you can use any surface, you can walk up to any surface, including your hand, if nothing else is available, and interact with this projected data. 
The device is completely portable, and can be -- (Applause) (Applause ends) So, one important difference is that it's totally mobile. 
Another even more important difference is that in mass production, this would not cost more tomorrow than today's cell phones and would actually not sort of be a bigger packaging -- could look a lot more stylish than this version that I'm wearing around my neck. 
But other than letting some of you live out your fantasy of looking as cool as Tom Cruise in "Minority Report," the reason why we're really excited about this device is that it really can act as one of these sixth-sense devices that gives you relevant information about whatever is in front of you. 
So we see Pranav here going into the supermarket and he's shopping for some paper towels. 
And, as he picks up a product, the system can recognize the product that he's picking up, using either image recognition or marker technology, and give him the green light or an orange light. 
He can ask for additional information. 
So this particular choice here is a particularly good choice, given his personal criteria. 
Some of you may want the toilet paper with the most bleach in it rather than the most ecologically responsible choice. 
(Laughter) If he picks up a book in the bookstore, he can get an Amazon rating -- it gets projected right on the cover of the book. 
This is Juan's book, our previous speaker, which gets a great rating, by the way, at Amazon. 
And so, Pranav turns the page of the book and can then see additional information about the book -- reader comments, maybe sort of information by his favorite critic, etc. 
If he turns to a particular page, he finds an annotation by maybe an expert or a friend of ours that gives him a little bit of additional information about whatever is on that particular page. 
Reading the newspaper -- it never has to be outdated. 
(Laughter) You can get video annotations of the events that you're reading about. 
You can get the latest sports scores, etc. 
This is a more controversial one. 
(Laughter) As you interact with someone at TED, maybe you can see a word cloud of the tags, the words that are associated with that person in their blog and personal web pages. 
In this case, the student is interested in cameras, etc. 
On your way to the airport, if you pick up your boarding pass, it can tell you that your flight is delayed, that the gate has changed, etc. 
And, if you need to know what the current time is, it's as simple as drawing a watch -- (Laughter) (Applause) on your arm. 
So that's where we're at so far in developing this sixth sense that would give us seamless access to all this relevant information about the things that we may come across. 
My student Pranav, who's really, like I said, the genius behind this. 
(Applause and cheering) (Applause ends) He does deserve a lot of applause, because I don't think he's slept much in the last three months, actually. 
And his girlfriend is probably not very happy about him either. 
But it's not perfect yet, it's very much a work in progress. 
And who knows, maybe in another 10 years we'll be here with the ultimate sixth sense brain implant. 
Thank you. 

For a really long time, I had two mysteries that were hanging over me. 
I didn't understand them and, to be honest, I was quite afraid to look into them. 
The first mystery was, I'm 40 years old, and all throughout my lifetime, year after year, serious depression and anxiety have risen, in the United States, in Britain, and across the Western world. 
And I wanted to understand why. 
Why is this happening to us? 
Why is it that with each year that passes, more and more of us are finding it harder to get through the day? 
And I wanted to understand this because of a more personal mystery. 
When I was a teenager, I remember going to my doctor and explaining that I had this feeling, like pain was leaking out of me. 
I couldn't control it, I didn't understand why it was happening, I felt quite ashamed of it. 
And my doctor told me a story that I now realize was well-intentioned, but quite oversimplified. 
Not totally wrong. 
My doctor said, "We know why people get like this. 
Some people just naturally get a chemical imbalance in their heads -- you're clearly one of them. 
All we need to do is give you some drugs, it will get your chemical balance back to normal." 
So I started taking a drug called Paxil or Seroxat, it's the same thing with different names in different countries. 
And I felt much better, I got a real boost. 
But not very long afterwards, this feeling of pain started to come back. 
So I was given higher and higher doses until, for 13 years, I was taking the maximum possible dose that you're legally allowed to take. 
And for a lot of those 13 years, and pretty much all the time by the end, I was still in a lot of pain. 
And I started asking myself, "What's going on here? 
Because you're doing everything you're told to do by the story that's dominating the culture -- why do you still feel like this?" 
So to get to the bottom of these two mysteries, for a book that I've written I ended up going on a big journey all over the world, I traveled over 40,000 miles. 
I wanted to sit with the leading experts in the world about what causes depression and anxiety and crucially, what solves them, and people who have come through depression and anxiety and out the other side in all sorts of ways. 
And I learned a huge amount from the amazing people I got to know along the way. 
But I think at the heart of what I learned is, so far, we have scientific evidence for nine different causes of depression and anxiety. 
Two of them are indeed in our biology. 
Your genes can make you more sensitive to these problems, though they don't write your destiny. 
And there are real brain changes that can happen when you become depressed that can make it harder to get out. 
But most of the factors that have been proven to cause depression and anxiety are not in our biology. 
They are factors in the way we live. 
And once you understand them, it opens up a very different set of solutions that should be offered to people alongside the option of chemical antidepressants. 
For example, if you're lonely, you're more likely to become depressed. 
If, when you go to work, you don't have any control over your job, you've just got to do what you're told, you're more likely to become depressed. 
If you very rarely get out into the natural world, you're more likely to become depressed. 
And one thing unites a lot of the causes of depression and anxiety that I learned about. 
Not all of them, but a lot of them. 
Everyone here knows you've all got natural physical needs, right? 
Obviously. 
You need food, you need water, you need shelter, you need clean air. 
If I took those things away from you, you'd all be in real trouble, real fast. 
But at the same time, every human being has natural psychological needs. 
You need to feel you belong. 
You need to feel your life has meaning and purpose. 
You need to feel that people see you and value you. 
You need to feel you've got a future that makes sense. 
And this culture we built is good at lots of things. 
And many things are better than in the past -- I'm glad to be alive today. 
But we've been getting less and less good at meeting these deep, underlying psychological needs. 
And it's not the only thing that's going on, but I think it's the key reason why this crisis keeps rising and rising. 
And I found this really hard to absorb. 
I really wrestled with the idea of shifting from thinking of my depression as just a problem in my brain, to one with many causes, including many in the way we're living. 
And it only really began to fall into place for me when one day, I went to interview a South African psychiatrist named Dr. Derek Summerfield. 
He's a great guy. 
And Dr. Summerfield happened to be in Cambodia in 2001, when they first introduced chemical antidepressants for people in that country. 
And the local doctors, the Cambodians, had never heard of these drugs, so they were like, what are they? 
And he explained. 
And they said to him, "We don't need them, we've already got antidepressants." 
And he was like, "What do you mean?" 
He thought they were going to talk about some kind of herbal remedy, like St. John's Wort, ginkgo biloba, something like that. 
Instead, they told him a story. 
There was a farmer in their community who worked in the rice fields. 
And one day, he stood on a land mine left over from the war with the United States, and he got his leg blown off. 
So they him an artificial leg, and after a while, he went back to work in the rice fields. 
But apparently, it's super painful to work under water when you've got an artificial limb, and I'm guessing it was pretty traumatic to go back and work in the field where he got blown up. 
The guy started to cry all day, he refused to get out of bed, he developed all the symptoms of classic depression. 
The Cambodian doctor said, "This is when we gave him an antidepressant." 
And Dr. Summerfield said, "What was it?" 
They explained that they went and sat with him. 
They listened to him. 
They realized that his pain made sense -- it was hard for him to see it in the throes of his depression, but actually, it had perfectly understandable causes in his life. 
One of the doctors, talking to the people in the community, figured, "You know, if we bought this guy a cow, he could become a dairy farmer, he wouldn't be in this position that was screwing him up so much, he wouldn't have to go and work in the rice fields." 
So they bought him a cow. 
Within a couple of weeks, his crying stopped, within a month, his depression was gone. 
They said to doctor Summerfield, "So you see, doctor, that cow, that was an antidepressant, that's what you mean, right?" 
(Laughter) (Applause) If you'd been raised to think about depression the way I was, and most of the people here were, that sounds like a bad joke, right? 
"I went to my doctor for an antidepressant, she gave me a cow." 
But what those Cambodian doctors knew intuitively, based on this individual, unscientific anecdote, is what the leading medical body in the world, the World Health Organization, has been trying to tell us for years, based on the best scientific evidence. 
If you're depressed, if you're anxious, you're not weak, you're not crazy, you're not, in the main, a machine with broken parts. 
You're a human being with unmet needs. 
And it's just as important to think here about what those Cambodian doctors and the World Health Organization are not saying. 
They did not say to this farmer, "Hey, buddy, you need to pull yourself together. 
It's your job to figure out and fix this problem on your own." 
On the contrary, what they said is, "We're here as a group to pull together with you, so together, we can figure out and fix this problem." 
This is what every depressed person needs, and it's what every depressed person deserves. 
This is why one of the leading doctors at the United Nations, in their official statement for World Health Day, couple of years back in 2017, said we need to talk less about chemical imbalances and more about the imbalances in the way we live. 
Drugs give real relief to some people -- they gave relief to me for a while -- but precisely because this problem goes deeper than their biology, the solutions need to go much deeper, too. 
But when I first learned that, I remember thinking, "OK, I could see all the scientific evidence, I read a huge number of studies, I interviewed a huge number of the experts who were explaining this," but I kept thinking, "How can we possibly do that?" 
The things that are making us depressed are in most cases more complex than what was going on with this Cambodian farmer. 
Where do we even begin with that insight? 
But then, in the long journey for my book, all over the world, I kept meeting people who were doing exactly that, from Sydney, to San Francisco, to São Paulo. 
I kept meeting people who were understanding the deeper causes of depression and anxiety and, as groups, fixing them. 
Obviously, I can't tell you about all the amazing people I got to know and wrote about, or all of the nine causes of depression and anxiety that I learned about, because they won't let me give a 10-hour TED Talk -- you can complain about that to them. 
But I want to focus on two of the causes and two of the solutions that emerge from them, if that's alright. 
Here's the first. 
We are the loneliest society in human history. 
There was a recent study that asked Americans, "Do you feel like you're no longer close to anyone?" 
And 39 percent of people said that described them. 
"No longer close to anyone." 
In the international measurements of loneliness, Britain and the rest of Europe are just behind the US, in case anyone here is feeling smug. 
(Laughter) I spent a lot of time discussing this with the leading expert in the world on loneliness, an incredible man named professor John Cacioppo, who was at Chicago, and I thought a lot about one question his work poses to us. 
Professor Cacioppo asked, "Why do we exist? 
Why are we here, why are we alive?" 
One key reason is that our ancestors on the savannas of Africa were really good at one thing. 
They weren't bigger than the animals they took down a lot of the time, they weren't faster than the animals they took down a lot of the time, but they were much better at banding together into groups and cooperating. 
This was our superpower as a species -- we band together, just like bees evolved to live in a hive, humans evolved to live in a tribe. 
And we are the first humans ever to disband our tribes. 
And it is making us feel awful. 
But it doesn't have to be this way. 
One of the heroes in my book, and in fact, in my life, is a doctor named Sam Everington. 
He's a general practitioner in a poor part of East London, where I lived for many years. 
And Sam was really uncomfortable, because he had loads of patients coming to him with terrible depression and anxiety. 
And like me, he's not opposed to chemical antidepressants, he thinks they give some relief to some people. 
But he could see two things. 
Firstly, his patients were depressed and anxious a lot of the time for totally understandable reasons, like loneliness. 
And secondly, although the drugs were giving some relief to some people, for many people, they didn't solve the problem. 
The underlying problem. 
One day, Sam decided to pioneer a different approach. 
A woman came to his center, his medical center, called Lisa Cunningham. 
I got to know Lisa later. 
And Lisa had been shut away in her home with crippling depression and anxiety for seven years. 
And when she came to Sam's center, she was told, "Don't worry, we'll carry on giving you these drugs, but we're also going to prescribe something else. 
We're going to prescribe for you to come here to this center twice a week to meet with a group of other depressed and anxious people, not to talk about how miserable you are, but to figure out something meaningful you can all do together so you won't be lonely and you won't feel like life is pointless." 
The first time this group met, Lisa literally started vomiting with anxiety, it was so overwhelming for her. 
But people rubbed her back, the group started talking, they were like, "What could we do?" 
These are inner-city, East London people like me, they didn't know anything about gardening. 
They were like, "Why don't we learn gardening?" 
There was an area behind the doctors' offices that was just scrubland. 
"Why don't we make this into a garden?" 
They started to take books out of the library, started to watch YouTube clips. 
They started to get their fingers in the soil. 
They started to learn the rhythms of the seasons. 
There's a lot of evidence that exposure to the natural world is a really powerful antidepressant. 
But they started to do something even more important. 
They started to form a tribe. 
They started to form a group. 
They started to care about each other. 
If one of them didn't show up, the others would go looking for them -- "Are you OK?" 
Help them figure out what was troubling them that day. 
The way Lisa put it to me, "As the garden began to bloom, we began to bloom." 
This approach is called social prescribing, it's spreading all over Europe. 
And there's a small, but growing body of evidence suggesting it can produce real and meaningful falls in depression and anxiety. 
And one day, I remember standing in the garden that Lisa and her once-depressed friends had built -- it's a really beautiful garden -- and having this thought, it's very much inspired by a guy called professor Hugh Mackay in Australia. 
I was thinking, so often when people feel down in this culture, what we say to them -- I'm sure everyone here said it, I have -- we say, "You just need to be you, be yourself." 
And I've realized, actually, what we should say to people is, "Don't be you. 
Don't be yourself. 
Be us, be we. 
Be part of a group." 
(Applause) The solution to these problems does not lie in drawing more and more on your resources as an isolated individual -- that's partly what got us in this crisis. 
It lies on reconnecting with something bigger than you. 
And that really connects to one of the other causes of depression and anxiety that I wanted to talk to you about. 
So everyone knows junk food has taken over our diets and made us physically sick. 
I don't say that with any sense of superiority, I literally came to give this talk from McDonald's. 
I saw all of you eating that healthy TED breakfast, I was like no way. 
But just like junk food has taken over our diets and made us physically sick, a kind of junk values have taken over our minds and made us mentally sick. 
For thousands of years, philosophers have said, if you think life is about money, and status and showing off, you're going to feel like crap. 
That's not an exact quote from Schopenhauer, but that is the gist of what he said. 
But weirdly, hardy anyone had scientifically investigated this, until a truly extraordinary person I got to know, named professor Tim Kasser, who's at Knox College in Illinois, and he's been researching this for about 30 years now. 
And his research suggests several really important things. 
Firstly, the more you believe you can buy and display your way out of sadness, and into a good life, the more likely you are to become depressed and anxious. 
And secondly, as a society, we have become much more driven by these beliefs. 
All throughout my lifetime, under the weight of advertising and Instagram and everything like them. 
And as I thought about this, I realized it's like we've all been fed since birth, a kind of KFC for the soul. 
We've been trained to look for happiness in all the wrong places, and just like junk food doesn't meet your nutritional needs and actually makes you feel terrible, junk values don't meet your psychological needs, and they take you away from a good life. 
But when I first spent time with professor Kasser and I was learning all this, I felt a really weird mixture of emotions. 
Because on the one hand, I found this really challenging. 
I could see how often in my own life, when I felt down, I tried to remedy it with some kind of show-offy, grand external solution. 
And I could see why that did not work well for me. 
I also thought, isn't this kind of obvious? 
Isn't this almost like banal, right? 
If I said to everyone here, none of you are going to lie on your deathbed and think about all the shoes you bought and all the retweets you got, you're going to think about moments of love, meaning and connection in your life. 
I think that seems almost like a cliché. 
But I kept talking to professor Kasser and saying, "Why am I feeling this strange doubleness?" 
And he said, "At some level, we all know these things. 
But in this culture, we don't live by them." 
We know them so well they've become clichés, but we don't live by them. 
I kept asking why, why would we know something so profound, but not live by it? 
And after a while, professor Kasser said to me, "Because we live in a machine that is designed to get us to neglect what is important about life." 
I had to really think about that. 
"Because we live in a machine that is designed to get us to neglect what is important about life." 
And professor Kasser wanted to figure out if we can disrupt that machine. 
He's done loads of research into this; I'll tell you about one example, and I really urge everyone here to try this with their friends and family. 
With a guy called Nathan Dungan, he got a group of teenagers and adults to come together for a series of sessions over a period of time, to meet up. 
And part of the point of the group was to get people to think about a moment in their life they had actually found meaning and purpose. 
For different people, it was different things. 
For some people, it was playing music, writing, helping someone -- I'm sure everyone here can picture something, right? 
And part of the point of the group was to get people to ask, "OK, how could you dedicate more of your life to pursuing these moments of meaning and purpose, and less to, I don't know, buying crap you don't need, putting it on social media and trying to get people to go, 'OMG, so jealous!'" And what they found was, just having these meetings, it was like a kind of Alcoholics Anonymous for consumerism, right? 
Getting people to have these meetings, articulate these values, determine to act on them and check in with each other, led to a marked shift in people's values. 
It took them away from this hurricane of depression-generating messages training us to seek happiness in the wrong places, and towards more meaningful and nourishing values that lift us out of depression. 
But with all the solutions that I saw and have written about, and many I can't talk about here, I kept thinking, you know: Why did it take me so long to see these insights? 
Because when you explain them to people -- some of them are more complicated, but not all -- when you explain this to people, it's not like rocket science, right? 
At some level, we already know these things. 
Why do we find it so hard to understand? 
I think there's many reasons. 
But I think one reason is that we have to change our understanding of what depression and anxiety actually are. 
There are very real biological contributions to depression and anxiety. 
But if we allow the biology to become the whole picture, as I did for so long, as I would argue our culture has done pretty much most of my life, what we're implicitly saying to people is, and this isn't anyone's intention, but what we're implicitly saying to people is, "Your pain doesn't mean anything. 
It's just a malfunction. 
It's like a glitch in a computer program, it's just a wiring problem in your head." 
But I was only able to start changing my life when I realized your depression is not a malfunction. 
It's a signal. 
Your depression is a signal. 
It's telling you something. 
(Applause) We feel this way for reasons, and they can be hard to see in the throes of depression -- I understand that really well from personal experience. 
But with the right help, we can understand these problems and we can fix these problems together. 
But to do that, the very first step is we have to stop insulting these signals by saying they're a sign of weakness, or madness or purely biological, except for a tiny number of people. 
We need to start listening to these signals, because they're telling us something we really need to hear. 
It's only when we truly listen to these signals, and we honor these signals and respect these signals, that we're going to begin to see the liberating, nourishing, deeper solutions. 
The cows that are waiting all around us. 
Thank you. 
(Applause) 

The world today has many problems. 
And they're all very complicated and interconnected and difficult. 
But there is something we can do. 
I believe that girls' education is the closest thing we have to a silver bullet to help solve some of the world's most difficult problems. 
But you don't have to take my word for it. 
The World Bank says that girls' education is one of the best investments that a country can make. 
It helps to positively impact nine of the 17 Sustainable Development Goals. 
Everything from health, nutrition, employment -- all of these are positively impacted when girls are educated. 
Additionally, climate scientists have recently rated girls' education at number six out of 80 actions to reverse global warming. 
At number six, it's rated higher than solar panels and electric cars. 
And that's because when girls are educated, they have smaller families, and the resulting reduction in population reduces carbon emissions significantly. 
But more than that, you know, it's a problem we have to solve once. 
Because an educated mother is more than twice as likely to educate her children. 
Which means that by doing it once, we can close the gender and literacy gap forever. 
I work in India, which has made incredible progress in bringing elementary education for all. 
However, we still have four million out-of-school girls, one of the highest in the world. 
And girls are out of school because of, obviously poverty, social, cultural factors. 
But there's also this underlying factor of mindset. 
I have met a girl whose name was Naraaz Nath. 
Naaraaz means angry. 
And when I asked her, "Why is your name 'angry'?" 
she said, "Because everybody was so angry when a girl was born." 
Another girl called Antim Bala, which means the last girl. 
Because everybody hoped that would be the last girl to be born. 
A girl called Aachuki. 
It means somebody who has arrived. 
Not wanted, but arrived. 
And it is this mindset that keeps girls from school or completing their education. 
It's this belief that a goat is an asset and a girl is a liability. 
My organization Educate Girls works to change this. 
And we work in some of the most difficult, rural, remote and tribal villages. 
And how do we do it? 
We first and foremost find young, passionate, educated youth from the same villages. 
Both men and women. 
And we call them Team Balika, balika just means the girl child, so this is a team that we are creating for the girl child. 
And so once we recruit our community volunteers, we train them, we mentor them, we hand-hold them. 
That's when our work starts. 
And the first piece we do is about identifying every single girl who's not going to school. 
But the way we do it is a little different and high-tech, at least in my view. 
Each of our frontline staff have a smartphone. 
It has its own Educate Girls app. 
And this app has everything that our team needs. 
It has digital maps of where they're going to be conducting the survey, it has the survey in it, all the questions, little guides on how best to conduct the survey, so that the data that comes to us is in real time and is of good quality. 
So armed with this, our teams and our volunteers go door-to-door to every single household to find every single girl who may either we never enrolled or dropped out of school. 
And because we have this data and technology piece, very quickly we can figure out who the girls are and where they are. 
Because each of our villages are geotagged, and we can actually build that information out very, very quickly. 
And so once we know where the girls are, we actually start the process of bringing them back into school. 
And that actually is just our community mobilization process, it starts with village meetings, neighborhood meetings, and as you see, individual counseling of parents and families, to be able to bring the girls back into school. 
And this can take anything from a few weeks to a few months. 
And once we bring the girls into the school system, we also work with the schools to make sure that schools have all the basic infrastructure so that the girls will be able to stay. 
And this would include a separate toilet for girls, drinking water, things that will help them to be retained. 
But all of this would be useless if our children weren't learning. 
So we actually run a learning program. 
And this is a supplementary learning program, and it's very, very important, because most of our children are first-generation learners. 
That means there's nobody at home to help them with homework, there's nobody who can support their education. 
Their parents can't read and write. 
So it's really, really key that we do the support of the learning in the classrooms. 
So this is essentially our model, in terms of finding, bringing the girls in, making sure that they're staying and learning. 
And we know that our model works. 
And we know this because a most recent randomized control evaluation confirms its efficacy. 
Our evaluator found that over a three-year period Educate Girls was able to bring back 92 percent of all out-of-school girls back into school. 
(Applause) And in terms of learning, our children's learning went up significantly as compared to control schools. 
So much so, that it was like an additional year of schooling for the average student. 
And that's enormous, when you think about a tribal child who's entering the school system for the first time. 
So here we have a model that works; we know it's scalable, because we are already functioning at 13,000 villages. 
We know it's smart, because of the use of data and technology. 
We know that it's sustainable and systemic, because we work in partnership with the community, it's actually led by the community. 
And we work in partnership with the government, so there's no creation of a parallel delivery system. 
And so because we have this innovative partnership with the community, the government, this smart model, we have this big, audacious dream today. 
And that is to solve a full 40 percent of the problem of out-of-school girls in India in the next five years. 
(Applause) And you're thinking, that's a little ... 
You know, how am I even thinking about doing that, because India is not a small place, it's a huge country. 
It's a country of over a billion people. 
We have 650,000 villages. 
How is it that I'm standing here, saying that one small organization is going to solve a full 40 percent of the problem? 
And that's because we have a key insight. 
And that is, because of our entire approach, with data and with technology, that five percent of villages in India have 40 percent of the out-of-school girls. 
And this is a big, big piece of the puzzle. 
Which means, I don't have to work across the entire country. 
I have to work in those five percent of the villages, about 35,000 villages, to actually be able to solve a large piece of the problem. 
And that's really key, because these villages not only have high burden of out-of-school girls, but also a lot of related indicators, right, like malnutrition, stunting, poverty, infant mortality, child marriage. 
So by working and focusing here, you can actually create a large multiplier effect across all of these indicators. 
And it would mean that we would be able to bring back 1.6 million girls back into school. 
(Applause) I have to say, I have been doing this for over a decade, and I have never met a girl who said to me, you know, "I want to stay at home," "I want to graze the cattle," "I want to look after the siblings," "I want to be a child bride." 
Every single girl I meet wants to go to school. 
And that's what we really want to do. 
We want to be able to fulfill those 1.6 million dreams. 
And it doesn't take much. 
To find and enroll a girl with our model is about 20 dollars. 
To make sure that she is learning and providing a learning program, it's another 40 dollars. 
But today is the time to do it. 
Because she is truly the biggest asset we have. 
I am Safeena Husain, and I educate girls. 
Thank you. 
(Applause) 

[This talk contains mature content] Six years ago, I discovered something that scientists have been wanting to know for years. 
How do you capture the attention of a roomful of extremely bored teenagers? 
It turns out all you have to do is mention the word pornography. 
(Laughter) Let me tell you how I first learned this. 
In 2012, I was sitting in a crowded room full of high school students who were attending an after-school program in Boston. 
And my job, as guest speaker for the day, was to inspire them to think about how exciting it would be to have a career in public health. 
The problem was, as I looked at their faces, I could see that their eyes were glazing over, and they were just tuning out. 
It didn't even matter that I wore what I thought was my cool outfit that day. 
I was just losing my audience. 
So, then one of the two adults who worked for the program said, "Aren't you doing some research about pornography? 
Maybe tell them about that." 
All of a sudden, that room full of high school students exploded into laughter, high fives. 
I think there were some loud hooting noises. 
And all anyone had done was say that one word -- pornography. 
That moment would prove to be an important turning point for me and my professional mission of finding solutions to end dating and sexual violence. 
At that point, I'd been working for more than a decade on this seemingly intractable problem of dating violence. 
Data from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention demonstrate that one in five high school-attending youth experience physical and/or sexual abuse by a dating partner each year in the US. 
That makes dating violence more prevalent than being bullied on school property, seriously considering suicide, or even vaping, in that same population. 
But solutions were proving elusive. 
And I was working with a research team that was hunting for novel answers to the question: What's causing dating abuse, and how do we stop it? 
One of the research studies that we were working on at the time happened to include a few questions about pornography. 
And something unexpected was emerging from our findings. 
Eleven percent of the teen girls in our sample reported that they had been forced or threatened to do sexual things that the perpetrator saw in pornography. 
That got me curious. 
Was pornography to blame for any percentage of dating violence? 
Or was it more like a coincidence that the pornography users also happen to be more likely to be in unhealthy relationships? 
I investigated by reading everything that I could from the peer-reviewed literature, and by conducting my own research. 
I wanted to know what kinds of sexually explicit media youth were watching, and how often and why, and see if I could piece together if it was part of the reason that for so many of them dating relationships were apparently unhealthy. 
As I read, I tried to keep an open mind, even though there were plenty of members of the public who'd already made up their mind about the issue. 
Why would I keep an open mind about pornography? 
Well, I'm a trained social scientist, so it's my job to be objective. 
But I'm also what people call sex-positive. 
That means that I fully support people's right to enjoy whatever kind of sex life and sexuality they find fulfilling, no matter what it involves, as long as it includes the enthusiastic consent of all parties involved. 
That said, I personally wasn't inclined towards watching pornography. 
I'd seen some, didn't really do anything for me. 
And as a mom of two soon-to-be teenage children, I had my own concerns about what seeing pornography could do to them. 
I noticed that while there were a lot of people who were denouncing pornography, there were also people who were staunch defenders of it for a variety of reasons. 
So in my scholarly exploration, I genuinely tried to understand: Was pornography bad for you or was it good for you? 
Was it misogynist or was it empowering? 
And there was not one singular answer that emerged clearly. 
There was one longitudinal study that had me really worried, that showed that teenagers who saw pornography were subsequently more likely to perpetrate sexual violence. 
But the design of the study didn't allow for definitive causal conclusions. 
And there were other studies that did not find that adolescent pornography use was associated with certain negative outcomes. 
Even though there were other studies that did find that. 
But as I spoke to other experts, I felt tremendous pressure to pick a side about pornography. 
Join one team or the other. 
I was even told that it was weak-minded of me not to be able to pick out the one correct answer about pornography. 
And it was complicated, because there is an industry that is capitalizing off of audience's fascination with seeing women, in particular, not just having sex, but being chocked, gagged, slapped, spit upon, ejaculated upon, called degrading names over and over during sex, and not always clearly with their consent. 
Most people would agree that we have a serious problem with misogyny, sexual violence and rape in this country, and pornography probably isn't helping with any of that. 
And a critically important problem to me was that for more than a century, the anti-pornography position had been used as a pretext for discriminating against gays and lesbians or people who have kinks or have fetishes. 
So I could see why, on the one hand, we might be very worried about the messages that pornography is sending, and on the other hand, why we might be really worried about going overboard indicting it. 
For the next two years, I looked into every scary, horrifying claim that I could find about the average age at which people first see pornography, or what it does to their brains or their sexuality. 
Here's what I have to report back. 
The free, online, mainstream pornography, that's the kind that teenagers are most likely to see, is a completely terrible form of sex education. 
(Laughter) (Applause) But that's not what it was intended for. 
And it probably is not instantly poisoning their minds or turning them into compulsive users, the way that some ideologues would have you believe. 
It's a rare person who doesn't see some pornography in their youth. 
By the time they're 18 years old, 93 percent of first year college males and 62 percent of females have seen pornography at least once. 
And though people like to say that the internet has made pornography ubiquitous, or basically guarantees that any young child who's handed a smartphone is definitely going to see pornography, data don't really support that. 
A nationally representative study found that in the year 2000 16 percent of 10-to-13-year-old youth reported that they'd seen pornography in the past year. 
And by 2010, that figure had increased. 
But only to 30 percent. 
So it wasn't everybody. 
Our problems with adolescents and sexual violence perpetration is not only because of pornography. 
In fact, a recent study found that adolescents are more likely to see sexualized images in other kinds of media besides pornography. 
Think about all those sexualized video games, or TV shows, or music videos. 
And it could be exposure to a steady stream of violent media that instead of or in addition to the sexualized images is causing our problems. 
By focusing on the potential harms of pornography alone, we may be distracting ourselves from bigger issues. 
Or missing root causes of dating and sexual violence, which are the true public health crises. 
That said, even my own research demonstrates that adolescents are turning to pornography for education and information about sex. 
And that's because they can't find reliable and factual information elsewhere. 
Less than 50 percent of the states in the United States require that sex education be taught in schools, including how to prevent coerced sex. 
And less than half of those states require that the information presented be medically accurate. 
So in that Boston after-school program, those kids really wanted to talk about sex, and they really wanted to talk about pornography. 
And they wanted to talk about those things a whole lot more than they wanted to talk about dating or sexual violence. 
So we realized, we could cover all of the same topics that we might normally talk about under the guise of healthy relationships education, like, what's a definition of sexual consent? 
Or, how do you know if you're hurting somebody during sex? 
Or what are healthy boundaries to have when you're flirting? 
All of these same things we could discuss by using pornography as the jumping-off point for our conversation. 
It's sort of like when adults give kids a desert like brownies, but they secretly baked a zucchini or something healthy inside of it. 
(Laughter) We could talk to the kids about the healthy stuff, the stuff that's good for you, but hide it inside a conversation that was about something that they thought they wanted to be talking about. 
We also discovered something that we didn't necessarily set out to find, which is that there's a fantastic way to have a conversation with teenagers about pornography. 
And that is, keep the conversation true to science. 
Admit what we know and what we don't know about the impact of pornography. 
Talk about where there are mixed results or where there are weaknesses in the studies that have been conducted. 
Invite the adolescents to become critical consumers of the research literature on pornography, as well as the pornography itself. 
That really fits with adolescent development. 
Adolescents like to question things and they like to be invited to think for themselves. 
And we realized by starting to experiment, teaching some classes in consent, respect and pornography, that trying to scare adolescents into a particular point of view or jam a one-sided argument down their throat about pornography not only probably does not work, but really doesn't model the kind of respectful, consensual behavior that we want them to learn. 
So our approach, what we call pornography literacy, is about presenting the truth about pornography to the best of our knowledge, given that there is an ever-changing evidence base. 
When people hear that we teach a nine-session, 18-hour class in pornography literacy to teenagers, I think that they either think that we're sitting kids down and trying to show them how to watch pornography, which is not what we do, or that we're part of an anti-pornography activist group that's trying to convince them that if they ever saw pornography, it would be the number one worst thing for their health ever. 
And that's not it, either. 
Our secret ingredient is that we're nonjudgmental. 
We don't think that youth should be watching pornography. 
But, above all, we want them to become critical thinkers if and when they do see it. 
And we've learned, from the number of requests for our curriculum and our training, from across the US and beyond, that there are a lot of parents and a lot of teachers who really do want to be having these more nuanced and realistic conversations with teenagers about pornography. 
We've had requests from Utah to Vermont, to Alabama, to Hawaii. 
So in that after-school program, what I saw, is that from the minute we mentioned the word pornography, those kids were ready to jump in to a back-and-forth about what they did and didn't want to see in pornography, and what they did and didn't want to do during sex. 
And what was degrading to women or unfair to men or racist, all of it. 
And they made some really sophisticated points. 
Exactly the kinds of things that we would want them to be talking about as violence prevention activists. 
And as teachers, we might leave the class one day and think, "It is really sad that there's that one boy in our class who thinks that all women have orgasms from anal sex." 
And we might leave class the next week and think, "I'm really glad that there's that one kid in our class who's gay, who said that seeing his sexuality represented in pornography saved his life." 
Or, "There's that one girl in our class who said that she's feeling a lot better about her body, because she saw someone shaped like her as the object of desire in some tame pornography." 
So this is where I find myself as a violence prevention activist. 
I find myself talking about and researching pornography. 
And though it would be easier if things in life were all one way or the other, what I've found in my conversations with teenagers about pornography is that they remain engaged in these conversations because we allow them to grapple with the complexities. 
And because we're honest about the science. 
These adolescents may not be adults yet, but they are living in an adult world. 
And they're ready for adult conversations. 
Thank you. 
(Applause) 

I never planned to become a climate activist. 
But things have changed, and now, standing here as a climate activist, I ask you all to become one, too. 
Here's why, and most importantly, how. 
Ten years ago, when I was 13 years old, I first learned about the greenhouse effect. 
Back then, we spent 90 minutes on this issue, and I remember finding it quite irritating that something so fundamental would be squeezed into a single geography lesson. 
Some of this irritation remained, so when I graduated from high school, I decided to study geography, just to make sure I was on the right track with this whole climate change thing. 
And this is when everything changed. 
This was the first time I looked at the data, at the science behind the climate crisis, and I couldn't believe what I was reading. 
Like many of you, I thought that the planet wasn't really in a good state. 
I had no idea that we are rushing into this self-made disaster in such a rapid pace. 
There was also the first time I understood what difference it makes when you consider the bigger picture. 
Take the CO2 concentration in the atmosphere, for instance, the number one driver for global warming. 
Yes, this looks bad. 
This looks like we are on a pretty bad track. 
But it's only once you don't just consider the last 60 years but the last 10,000 years that you understand how terrifying this really is. 
And this is just one aspect of the crisis we're seeing. 
I'm not going to get into details here, but let me tell you so much: we are in a point of history that the most destructive force on the planet is humanity itself. 
We are in a point of history that no scientist could guarantee you that you will survive this. 
We are in a point of history that humanity is creating an environment that's not safe for humans anymore. 
Yeah, there I was, first year of geography, and felt pretty overwhelmed. 
But ... 
there was good news. 
The very same year I first learned about all this, leaders from across the globe came together in Paris to decide on the common target to limit global warming to below two degrees. 
Pictures went around the world, and I was told that history was made that day. 
How relieving, right? 
Except ... 
something didn't quite work out about this. 
After this agreement was signed, things didn't really get better. 
Actually, they got much worse. 
Decision makers and industries, leaders and politicians, they went back to business as usual, exploiting our livelihoods like there is literally no tomorrow, building coal power plants again and again, even though we know that needs to stop, according to the Paris Agreement. 
So while there are also good developments, of course -- there are installations of wind and solar energy all over the globe, yes -- but these positive changes are slow -- too slow, in fact. 
So since the Paris Agreement was signed, climate graphs keep racing to the top, smashing records every year. 
The five hottest years ever recorded were the previous five years, and at no time have global emissions been higher than today. 
So there I was, seeing and understanding the science on the one side, but not seeing answers, not seeing the action, on the other side. 
At that point, I had enough. 
I wanted to go to the UN Climate Conference myself, that very place that was created to bring people together to fix the climate -- except not really, apparently. 
This was last year. 
I traveled to the Climate Conference and wanted to find out what this is really like, what this is about. 
For political realists, this might be no surprise, but I found it hard to bear: that fossil fuel industries and political leaders are doing everything, everything to prevent real change from happening. 
They are not keen to set targets that are ambitious enough to put us on a below-two-degree pathway. 
After all, these are the only ones who benefit from this climate crisis, right? 
The fossil fuel industry generates profits, and political leaders, well, they look at the next election, at what makes them popular, and I guess that's not asking the inconvenient questions. 
There is no intention for them to change the game. 
There is no country in the world where either companies or political powers are sanctioned for wrecking the climate. 
With all the strangeness and the sadness about this conference, there was one someone who was different, someone who seemed to be quite worried, and that was Greta Thunberg. 
I decided right there that everything else seemed hopeless and didn't seem to make sense, so I joined her climate strike right there at the conference. 
It was my very first climate strike ever and an incredibly strange setting, just me and her sitting there at this conference hall, surrounded by this busyness of the suit-wearing conference crowd who had no idea what to do with us. 
And yet, this felt more powerful than anything I had expected in a very long time. 
And it was right there that I felt it was maybe time to start striking in Germany. 
I was now certain that no one else was going to fix this for us, and if there was just the slightest chance that this could make a difference, it seemed almost foolish not to give it a go. 
So I -- (Applause) So I traveled back to Berlin. 
I found allies who had the same idea at the same time, and together we thought we'd give this "Fridays For Future" thing a go. 
Obviously, we had no idea what we were getting into. 
Before our first strike, many of us, including me, had never organized a public demonstration or any kind of protest before. 
We had no money, no resources and absolutely no idea what climate striking really is. 
So we started doing what we were good at: we started texting, texting en masse, night and day, everyone we could reach, organizing our first climate strike via WhatsApp. 
The night before our first strike, I was so nervous I couldn't sleep. 
I didn't know what to expect, but I expected the worst. 
Maybe it was because we weren't the only ones who had been longing to have a voice in a political environment that had seemingly forgotten how to include young people's perspective into decision-making, maybe. 
But somehow this worked out. 
And from one day to the other, we were all over the place. 
And I, from one day to the other, became a climate activist. 
Usually, in these kind of TED Talks, I would now say how it's overly hopeful, how we young people are going to get this sorted, how we're going to save the future and the planet and everything else, how we young people striking for the climate are going to fix this. 
Usually. 
But this is not how this works. 
This is not how this crisis works. 
Here's a twist: today, three and a half years after that Paris Agreement was signed, when we look at the science, we find it's still possible to keep global warming to below two degrees -- technically. 
And we also see it's still possible to hold other disastrous developments we're seeing, such as mass extinction and soil degradation -- yes, technically. 
It's just incredibly, incredibly unlikely. 
And in any case, the world would have to see changes which we have never experienced before. 
We'd have to fully decarbonize our economies by 2050 and transform the distribution of powers that is currently allowing those fossil fuel giants and political leaders to stay on top of the game. 
We are talking of nothing less than the greatest transformation since the Industrial Revolution. 
We are talking, if you want to put it that way, we are talking of a climate revolution in a minimum amount of time. 
We wouldn't have a single further year to lose. 
And in any case, for any of that change to happen, the world needs to stop relying on one or two or three million school strikers to sort this out. 
Yes, we are great, we are going to keep going, and we are going to go to places no one ever expected us, yes. 
But we are not the limit; we are the start. 
This is not a job for a single generation. 
This is a job for humanity. 
And this is when all eyes are on you. 
For this change to happen, we will have to get one million things sorted. 
It's an incredibly complex thing, after all. 
But ... 
there are some things that everyone can get started with. 
Bad news first: if you thought I would tell you now to cycle more or eat less meat, to fly less, or to go secondhand shopping, sorry, this is not that easy. 
But here comes the good news: you are more than consumers and shoppers, even though the industry would like you to keep yourselves limited to that. 
No; me and you -- we are all political beings, and we can all be part of this answer. 
We can all be something that many people call climate activists. 
Yay? 
(Laughter) So what are the first steps? 
Four first steps that are essential to get everything else done, four first steps that everyone can get started with, four first steps that decide about everything that can happen after. 
So what's that? 
Number one: we need to drastically reframe our understanding of a climate activist, our understanding of who can be the answer to this. 
A climate activist isn't that one person that's read every single study and is now spending every afternoon handing out leaflets about vegetarianism in shopping malls. 
No. 
A climate activist can be everyone, everyone who wants to join a movement of those who intend to grow old on a planet that prioritizes protection of natural environments and happiness and health for the many over the destruction of the climate and the wrecking of the planet for the profits of the few. 
And since the climate crisis is affecting every single part of our social, of our political and of our private life, we need climate activists everywhere on every corner, not only in every room, but also in every city and country and state and continent. 
Second: I need you to get out of that zone of convenience, away from a business as usual that has no tomorrow. 
All of you here, you are either a friend or a family member, you are a worker, a colleague, a student, a teacher or, in many cases, a voter. 
All of this comes along with a responsibility that this crisis requires you to grow up to. 
There's the company that employs you or that sponsors you. 
Is it on track of meeting the Paris Agreement? 
Does your local parliamentarian know that you care about this, that you want this to be a priority in every election? 
Does your best friend know about this? 
Do you read a newspaper or write a newspaper? Great. 
Then let them know you want them to report on this in every issue, and that you want them to challenge decision makers in every single interview. 
If you're a singer, sing about this. If you're a teacher, teach about this. 
And if you have a bank account, tell your bank you're going to leave if they keep investing in fossil fuels. 
And, of course, on Fridays, you should all know what to do. 
Thirdly: leaving that zone of convenience works best when you join forces. 
One person asking for inconvenient change is mostly inconvenient. 
Two, five, ten, one hundred people asking for inconvenient change are hard to ignore. 
The more you are, the harder it gets for people to justify a system that has no future. 
Power is not something that you either have or don't have. 
Power is something you either take or leave to others, and it grows once you share it. 
We young people on the streets, we school strikers, we are showing how this can work out. 
One single school striker will always be one single school striker -- well, Greta Thunberg. 
Two, five, ten, one thousand people striking school are a movement, and that's what we need everywhere. 
No pressure. 
(Laughter) And number four, finally -- and this is probably the most important aspect of all of this -- I need you to start taking yourselves more seriously. 
If there's one thing I've learned during seven months of organizing climate action, it's that if you don't go for something, chances are high that no one else will. 
The most powerful institutions of this world have no intention of changing the game they're profiting from most, so there's no point in further relying on them. 
That's scary, I know. 
That's a huge responsibility, a huge burden on everyone's shoulders, yes. 
But this also means, if we want to, we can have a say in this. 
We can be part of that change. We can be part of that answer. 
And that's quite beautiful, right? 
So let's give it a try, let's rock and roll, let's flood the world with climate activists. 
Let's get out of the zones of convenience and join forces and start taking ourselves more seriously. 
Imagine what this world would look like, where children would grow up, knowing their future was this one great adventure to look forward to and nothing to be scared of, what this world would look like when the next climate conference is this great happening of people who come together, who had heard the voices of millions, who would then roll up their sleeves, ready to create real change. 
You know, I dream of this world where geography classes teach about the climate crisis as this one greatest challenge that was won by people like you and me, who had started acting in time because they understood they had nothing to lose and everything to win. 
So why not give it a go? 
No one else will save the future for us. 
This is more than an invitation. Spread the word. 
Thank you. 
(Applause) 

Oh, there's a lot of it. 
This is seaweed. 
It's pretty humble stuff. 
But it does have some remarkable qualities. 
For one, it grows really fast. 
So the carbon that is part of that seaweed, just a few weeks ago, was floating in the atmosphere as atmospheric CO2, driving all the adverse consequences of climate change. 
For the moment, it's locked safely away in the seaweed, but when that seaweed rots -- and by the smell of it, it's not far away -- when it rots, that CO2 will be released back to the atmosphere. 
Wouldn't it be fantastic if we could find a way of keeping that CO2 locked up long-term, and thereby significantly contributing to solving the climate problem? 
What I'm talking about here is drawdown. 
It's now become the other half of the climate challenge. 
And that's because we have delayed so long, in terms of addressing climate change, that we now have to do two very big and very difficult things at once. 
We have to cut our emissions and clean our energy supply at the same time that we draw significant volumes of carbon dioxide out of the atmosphere. 
If we don't do that, about 25 percent of the CO2 we put in the air will remain there, by human standards, forever. 
So we have to act. 
This is really a new phase in addressing the climate crisis and it demands new thinking. 
So, ideas like carbon offsets really don't make sense in the modern era. 
You know, when you offset something, you say, "I'll permit myself to put some greenhouse gas into the atmosphere, but then I'll offset it by drawing it down." 
When you've got to both cut your emissions and draw down CO2, that thinking doesn't make sense anymore. 
And when we're talking about drawdown, we're talking about putting large volumes of greenhouses gases, particularly CO2, out of circulation. 
And to do that, we need a carbon price. 
We need a significant price that we'll pay for that service that we'll all benefit from. 
We've made almost no progress so far with the second half of the climate challenge. 
It's not on most people's radar. 
And, you know, I must say, at times, I hear people saying, "I've lost hope that we can do anything about the climate crisis." 
And look, I've had my sleepless nights too, I can tell you. 
But I'm here today as an ambassador for this humble weed, seaweed. 
I think it has the potential to be a big part of addressing the challenge of climate change and a big part of our future. 
Now, what the scientists are telling us we need to do over the next 80-odd years to the end of this century, is to cut our greenhouse gas emissions by three percent every year, and draw three gigatons of CO2 out of the atmosphere every year. 
Those numbers are so large that they baffle us. 
But that's what the scientists tell us we need to do. 
I really hate showing this graph, but I'm sorry, I have to do it. 
It is very eloquent in terms of telling the story of my personal failure in terms of all the advocacy I've done in climate change work and in fact, our collective failure to address climate change. 
You can see our trajectory there in terms of warming and greenhouse gas concentrations. 
You can see all of the great scientific announcements that we've made, saying how much danger we face with climate change. 
You can see the political meetings. 
None of it has changed the trajectory. 
And this is why we need new thinking, we need a new approach. 
So how might we go about drawing down greenhouse gases at a large scale? 
There's really only two ways of doing it, and I've done a very deep dive into drawdown. 
And I'll preempt my -- And I would say this stuff comes up smelling like roses at the end of the day. 
It does, it's one of the best options, but there are many, many possibilities. 
There are chemical pathways and biological pathways. 
So two ways, really, of getting the job done. 
The biological pathways are fantastic because the energy source that's needed to drive them, the sun, is effectively free. 
We use the sun to drive photosynthesis in plants, break apart that CO2 and capture the carbon. 
There are also chemical pathways. 
They sound ominous, but actually, they're not bad at all. 
The difficulty they face is that we have to actually pay for the energy that's required to do the job or pay to facilitate that energy. 
Direct air capture is a great example of a chemical pathway, and people are using that right now to take CO2 out of the atmosphere and manufacture biofuels or manufacture plastics. 
Great progress is being made, but it will be many decades before those chemical pathways are drawing down a gigaton of CO2 a year. 
The biological pathways offer us a lot more hope, I think, in the short term. 
You've probably heard about reforestation, planting trees, as a solution to the climate problem. 
You know, it's a fair question: Can we plant our way out of this problem by using trees? 
I'm skeptical about that for a number of reasons. 
One is just the scale of the problem. 
All trees start as seeds, little tiny things, and it's many decades before they've reached their full carbon-capture potential. 
And secondly, if you look at the land surface, you see that it's so heavily utilized. 
We get our food from it, we get our forestry products from it, biodiversity protection and water and everything else. 
To expect that we'll find enough space to deal with this problem, I think is going to be quite problematic. 
But if we look offshore, wee see a solution where there's already an existing industry, and where there's a clearer way forward. 
The oceans cover about 70 percent of our planet. 
They play a really big role in regulating our climate, and if we can enhance the growth of seaweed in them, we can use them, I think, to develop a climate-altering crop. 
There are so many different kinds of seaweed, there's unbelievable genetic diversity in seaweed, and they're very ancient; they were some of the first multicellular organisms ever to evolve. 
People are using special kinds of seaweed now for particular purposes, like developing very high-quality pharmaceutical products. 
But you can also use seaweed to take a seaweed bath, it's supposed to be good for your skin; I can't testify to that, but you can do it. 
The scalability is the big thing about seaweed farming. 
You know, if we could cover nine percent of the world's ocean in seaweed farms, we could draw down the equivalent of all of the greenhouse gases we put up in any one year, more than 50 gigatons. 
Now, I thought that was fantastic when I first read it, but I thought I'd better calculate how big nine percent of the world's oceans is. 
It turns out, it's about four and a half Australias, the place I live in. 
And how close are we to that at the moment? 
How many ocean-going seaweed farms do we actually have out there? 
Zero. 
But we do have some prototypes, and therein lies some hope. 
This little drawing here of a seaweed farm that's currently under construction tells you some very interesting things about seaweed. 
You can see the seaweed growing on that rack, 25 meters down in the ocean there. 
It's really different from anything you see on land. 
And the reason being that, you know, seaweed is not like trees, it doesn't have nonproductive parts like roots and trunks and branches and bark. 
The whole of the plant is pretty much photosynthetic, so it grows fast. 
Seaweed can grow a meter a day. 
And how do we sequester the carbon? 
Again, it's very different from on land. 
All you need to do is cut that seaweed off -- drifts into the ocean abyss, Once it's down a kilometer, the carbon in that seaweed is effectively out of the atmospheric system for centuries or millennia. 
Whereas if you plant a forest, you've got to worry about forest fires, bugs, etc., releasing that carbon. 
The key to this farm, though, is that little pipe going down into the depths. 
You know, the mid-ocean is basically a vast biological desert. 
There's no nutrients there that were used up long ago. 
But just 500 meters down, there is cool, very nutrient-rich water. 
And with just a little bit of clean, renewable energy, you can pump that water up and use the nutrients in it to irrigate your seaweed crop. 
So I think this really has so many benefits. 
It's changing a biological desert, the mid-ocean, into a productive, maybe even planet-saving solution. 
So what could go wrong? 
Well, anything we're talking about at this scale involves a planetary-scale intervention. 
And we have to be very careful. 
I think that piles of stinking seaweed are probably going to be the least of our problems. 
There's other unforeseen things that will happen. 
One of the things that really worries me, when I talk about this, is the fate of biodiversity in the deep ocean. 
If we are putting gigatons of seaweed into the deep ocean, we're affecting life down there. 
The good news is that we know that a lot of seaweed already reaches the deep ocean, after storms or through submarine canyons. 
So we're not talking about a novel process here; we are talking about enhancing a natural process. 
And we'll learn as we go. 
I mean, it may be that these ocean-going seaweed farms will need to be mobile, to distribute the seaweed across vast areas of the ocean, rather than creating a big stinking pile in one place. 
It may be that we'll need to char the seaweed -- so create a sort of an inert, mineral biochar before we dispatch it into the deep. 
We won't know until we start the process, and we will learn effectively by doing. 
I just want to take you to contemporary seaweed farming. 
It's a big business -- it's a six-billion-dollar-a-year business. 
These seaweed farms off South Korea -- you can see them from space, they are huge. 
And they're increasingly not just seaweed farms. 
What people are doing in places like this is something called ocean permaculture. 
And in ocean permaculture, you grow fish, shellfish and seaweed all together. 
And the reason it works so well is that the seaweed makes the seawater less acid. 
It provides an ideal environment for growing marine protein. 
If we covered nine percent of the world's oceans in ocean permaculture, we would be producing enough protein in the form of fish and shellfish to give every person in a population of 10 billion 200 kilograms of high-quality protein per year. 
So, we've got a multipotent solution here. 
We can address climate change, we can feed the world, we can deacidify the oceans. 
The economics of all of this is going to be challenging. 
We'll be investing many, many billions of dollars into these solutions, and they will take decades to get to the gigaton scale. 
The reason that I'm convinced that this is going to happen is that unless we get the gas out of the air, it is going to keep driving adverse consequences. 
It will flood our cities, it will deprive us of food, it will cause all sorts of civil unrest. 
So anyone who's got a solution to dealing with this problem has a valuable asset. 
And already, as I've explained, ocean permaculture is well on the road to being economically sustainable. 
You know, in the next 30 years, we have to go from being a carbon-emitting economy to a carbon-absorbing economy. 
And that doesn't seem like very long. 
But half of the greenhouse gases that we've put into the atmosphere, we've put there in the last 30 years. 
My argument is, if we can put the gas in in 30 years, we can pull it out in 30 years. 
And if you doubt how much can be done over 30 years, just cast your mind back a century, to 1919, compare it with 1950. 
Now, in 1919, here in Edinburgh, you might have seen a canvas and wood biplane. 
Thirty years later, you'd be seeing jet aircraft. 
Transport in the street were horses in 1919. 
By 1950, they're motor vehicles. 
1919, we had gun powder; 1950, we had nuclear power. 
We can do a lot in a short period of time. 
But it all depends upon us believing that we can find a solution. 
Now what I would love to do is bring together all of the people with knowledge in this space. 
The engineers who know how to build structures offshore, the seaweed farmers, the financiers, the government regulators, the people who understand how things are done. 
And chart a way forward, say: How do we go from the existing six-billion-dollar-a-year, inshore seaweed industry, to this new form of industry, which has got so much potential, but will require large amounts of investment? 
I'm not a betting man, you know. 
But if I were, I'll tell you, my money would be on that stuff, it would be on seaweed. 
It's my hero. 
Thank you. 
(Applause) 

I am a capitalist, and after a 30-year career in capitalism spanning three dozen companies, generating tens of billions of dollars in market value, I'm not just in the top one percent, I'm in the top .01 percent of all earners. 
Today, I have come to share the secrets of our success, because rich capitalists like me have never been richer. 
So the question is, how do we do it? 
How do we manage to grab an ever-increasing share of the economic pie every year? 
Is it that rich people are smarter than we were 30 years ago? 
Is it that we're working harder than we once did? 
Are we taller, better looking? 
Sadly, no. 
It all comes down to just one thing: economics. 
Because, here's the dirty secret. 
There was a time in which the economics profession worked in the public interest, but in the neoliberal era, today, they work only for big corporations and billionaires, and that is creating a little bit of a problem. 
We could choose to enact economic policies that raise taxes on the rich, regulate powerful corporations or raise wages for workers. 
We have done it before. 
But neoliberal economists would warn that all of these policies would be a terrible mistake, because raising taxes always kills economic growth, and any form of government regulation is inefficient, and raising wages always kills jobs. 
Well, as a consequence of that thinking, over the last 30 years, in the USA alone, the top one percent has grown 21 trillion dollars richer while the bottom 50 percent have grown 900 billion dollars poorer, a pattern of widening inequality that has largely repeated itself across the world. 
And yet, as middle class families struggle to get by on wages that have not budged in about 40 years, neoliberal economists continue to warn that the only reasonable response to the painful dislocations of austerity and globalization is even more austerity and globalization. 
So, what is a society to do? 
Well, it's super clear to me what we need to do. 
We need a new economics. 
So, economics has been described as the dismal science, and for good reason, because as much as it is taught today, it isn't a science at all, in spite of all of the dazzling mathematics. 
In fact, a growing number of academics and practitioners have concluded that neoliberal economic theory is dangerously wrong and that today's growing crises of rising inequality and growing political instability are the direct result of decades of bad economic theory. 
What we now know is that the economics that made me so rich isn't just wrong, it's backwards, because it turns out it isn't capital that creates economic growth, it's people; and it isn't self-interest that promotes the public good, it's reciprocity; and it isn't competition that produces our prosperity, it's cooperation. 
What we can now see is that an economics that is neither just nor inclusive can never sustain the high levels of social cooperation necessary to enable a modern society to thrive. 
So where did we go wrong? 
Well, it turns out that it's become painfully obvious that the fundamental assumptions that undergird neoliberal economic theory are just objectively false, and so today first I want to take you through some of those mistaken assumptions and then after describe where the science suggests prosperity actually comes from. 
So, neoliberal economic assumption number one is that the market is an efficient equilibrium system, which basically means that if one thing in the economy, like wages, goes up, another thing in the economy, like jobs, must go down. 
So for example, in Seattle, where I live, when in 2014 we passed our nation's first 15 dollar minimum wage, the neoliberals freaked out over their precious equilibrium. 
"If you raise the price of labor," they warned, "businesses will purchase less of it. 
Thousands of low-wage workers will lose their jobs. 
The restaurants will close." 
Except ... 
they didn't. 
The unemployment rate fell dramatically. 
The restaurant business in Seattle boomed. 
Why? 
Because there is no equilibrium. 
Because raising wages doesn't kill jobs, it creates them; because, for instance, when restaurant owners are suddenly required to pay restaurant workers enough so that now even they can afford to eat in restaurants, it doesn't shrink the restaurant business, it grows it, obviously. 
(Applause) Thank you. 
The second assumption is that the price of something is always equal to its value, which basically means that if you earn 50,000 dollars a year and I earn 50 million dollars a year, that's because I produce a thousand times as much value as you. 
Now, it will not surprise you to learn that this is a very comforting assumption if you're a CEO paying yourself 50 million dollars a year but paying your workers poverty wages. 
But please, take it from somebody who has run dozens of businesses: this is nonsense. 
People are not paid what they are worth. 
They are paid what they have the power to negotiate, and wages' falling share of GDP is not because workers have become less productive but because employers have become more powerful. 
And -- (Applause) And by pretending that the giant imbalance in power between capital and labor doesn't exist, neoliberal economic theory became essentially a protection racket for the rich. 
The third assumption, and by far the most pernicious, is a behavioral model that describes human beings as something called "homo economicus," which basically means that we are all perfectly selfish, perfectly rational and relentlessly self-maximizing. 
But just ask yourselves, is it plausible that every single time for your entire life, when you did something nice for somebody else, all you were doing was maximizing your own utility? 
Is it plausible that when a soldier jumps on a grenade to defend fellow soldiers, they're just promoting their narrow self-interest? 
If you think that's nuts, contrary to any reasonable moral intuition, that's because it is and, according to the latest science, not true. 
But it is this behavioral model which is at the cold, cruel heart of neoliberal economics, and it is as morally corrosive as it is scientifically wrong because, if we accept at face value that humans are fundamentally selfish, and then we look around the world at all of the unambiguous prosperity in it, then it follows logically, then it must be true by definition, that billions of individual acts of selfishness magically transubstantiate into prosperity and the common good. 
If we humans are merely selfish maximizers, then selfishness is the cause of our prosperity. 
Under this economic logic, greed is good, widening inequality is efficient, and the only purpose of the corporation can be to enrich shareholders, because to do otherwise would be to slow economic growth and harm the economy overall. 
And it is this gospel of selfishness which forms the ideological cornerstone of neoliberal economics, a way of thinking which has produced economic policies which have enabled me and my rich buddies in the top one percent to grab virtually all of the benefits of growth over the last 40 years. 
But, if instead we accept the latest empirical research, real science, which correctly describes human beings as highly cooperative, reciprocal and intuitively moral creatures, then it follows logically that it must be cooperation and not selfishness that is the cause of our prosperity, and it isn't our self-interest but rather our inherent reciprocity that is humanity's economic superpower. 
So at the heart of this new economics is a story about ourselves that grants us permission to be our best selves, and, unlike the old economics, this is a story that is virtuous and also has the virtue of being true. 
Now, I want to emphasize that this new economics is not something I have personally imagined or invented. 
Its theories and models are being developed and refined in universities around the world building on some of the best new research in economics, complexity theory, evolutionary theory, psychology, anthropology and other disciplines. 
And although this new economics does not yet have its own textbook or even a commonly agreed upon name, in broad strokes its explanation of where prosperity comes from goes something like this. 
So, market capitalism is an evolutionary system in which prosperity emerges through a positive feedback loop between increasing amounts of innovation and increasing amounts of consumer demand. 
Innovation is the process by which we solve human problems, consumer demand is the mechanism through which the market selects for useful innovations, and as we solve more problems, we become more prosperous. 
But as we become more prosperous, our problems and solutions become more complex, and this increasing technical complexity requires ever higher levels of social and economic cooperation in order to produce the more highly specialized products that define a modern economy. 
Now, the old economics is correct, of course, that competition plays a crucial role in how markets work, but what it fails to see is that it is largely a competition between highly cooperative groups -- competition between firms, competition between networks of firms, competition between nations -- and anyone who has ever run a successful business knows that building a cooperative team by including the talents of everyone is almost always a better strategy than just a bunch of selfish jerks. 
So how do we leave neoliberalism behind and build a more sustainable, more prosperous and more equitable society? 
The new economics suggests just five rules of thumb. 
First is that successful economies are not jungles, they're gardens, which is to say that markets, like gardens, must be tended, that the market is the greatest social technology ever invented for solving human problems, but unconstrained by social norms or democratic regulation, markets inevitably create more problems than they solve. 
Climate change, the great financial crisis of 2008 are two easy examples. 
The second rule is that inclusion creates economic growth. 
So the neoliberal idea that inclusion is this fancy luxury to be afforded if and when we have growth is both wrong and backwards. 
The economy is people. 
Including more people in more ways is what causes economic growth in market economies. 
The third principle is the purpose of the corporation is not merely to enrich shareholders. 
The greatest grift in contemporary economic life is the neoliberal idea that the only purpose of the corporation and the only responsibility of executives is to enrich themselves and shareholders. 
The new economics must and can insist that the purpose of the corporation is to improve the welfare of all stakeholders: customers, workers, community and shareholders alike. 
Rule four: greed is not good. 
Being rapacious doesn't make you a capitalist, it makes you a sociopath. 
(Laughter) (Applause) And in an economy as dependent upon cooperation at scale as ours, sociopathy is as bad for business as it is for society. 
And fifth and finally, unlike the laws of physics, the laws of economics are a choice. 
Now, neoliberal economic theory has sold itself to you as unchangeable natural law, when in fact it's social norms and constructed narratives based on pseudoscience. 
If we truly want a more equitable, more prosperous and more sustainable economy, if we want high-functioning democracies and civil society, we must have a new economics. 
And here's the good news: if we want a new economics, all we have to do is choose to have it. 
Thank you. 
(Applause) Moderator: So Nick, I'm sure you get this question a lot. 
If you're so unhappy with the economic system, why not just give all your money away and join the 99 percent? 
Nick Hanauer: Yeah, no, yes, right. 
You get that a lot. You get that a lot. 
"If you care so much about taxes, why don't you pay more, and if you care so much about wages, why don't you pay more?" 
And I could do that. 
The problem is, it doesn't make that much difference, and I have discovered a strategy that works literally a hundred thousand times better -- Moderator: OK. 
NH: which is to use my money to build narratives and to pass laws that will require all the other rich people to pay taxes and pay their workers better. 
(Applause) And so, for example, the 15-dollar minimum wage that we cooked up has now affected 30 million workers. 
So that works better. 
Moderator: That's great. 
If you change your mind, we'll find some takers for you. 
NH: OK. Thank you. Moderator: Thank you very much. 

I am an astrophysicist. 
I research stellar explosions across the universe. 
But I have a flaw: I'm restless, and I get bored easily. 
And although as an astrophysicist, I have the incredible opportunity to study the entire universe, the thought of doing only that, always that, makes me feel caged and limited. 
What if my issues with keeping attention and getting bored were not a flaw, though? 
What if I could turn them into an asset? 
An astrophysicist cannot touch or interact with the things that she studies. 
No way to explode a star in a lab to figure out why or how it blew up. 
Just pictures and movies of the sky. 
Everything we know about the universe, from the big bang that originated space and time, to the formation and evolution of stars and galaxies, to the structure of our own solar system, we figured out studying images of the sky. 
And to study a system as complex as the entire universe, astrophysicists are experts at extracting simple models and solutions from large and complex data sets. 
So what else can I do with this expertise? 
What if we turned the camera around towards us? 
At the Urban Observatory, that is exactly what we are doing. 
Greg Dobler, also an astrophysicist and my husband, created the first urban observatory in New York University in 2013, and I joined in 2015. 
Here are some of the things that we do. 
We take pictures of the city at night and study city lights like stars. 
By studying how light changes over time and the color of astronomical lights, I gain insight about the nature of exploding stars. 
By studying city lights the same way, we can measure and predict how much energy the city needs and consumes and help build a resilient grid that will support the needs of growing urban environments. 
In daytime images, we capture plumes of pollution. 
Seventy-five percent of greenhouse gases in New York City come from a building like this one, burning oil for heat. 
You can measure pollution with air quality sensors. 
But imagine putting a sensor on each New York City building, reading in data from a million monitors. 
Imagine the cost. 
With a team of NYU students, we built a mathematical model, a neural network that can detect and track these plumes over the New York City skyline. 
We can classify them -- harmless steam plumes, white and evanescent; polluting smokestacks, dark and persistent -- and provide policy makers with a map of neighborhood pollution. 
This cross-disciplinary project created transformational solutions. 
But the data analysis methodologies we use in astrophysics can be applied to all sorts of data, not just images. 
We were asked to help a California district attorney understand prosecutorial delays in their jurisdiction. 
There are people on probation or sitting in jail, awaiting for trial sometimes for years. 
They wanted to know what kind of cases dragged on, and they had a massive data set to explore to understand it, but didn't have the expertise or the instruments in their office to do so. 
And that's where we came in. 
I worked with my colleague, public policy professor Angela Hawken, and our team first created a visual dashboard for DAs to see and better understand the prosecution process. 
But also, we ourselves analyzed their data, looking to see if the duration of the process suffered from social inequalities in their jurisdiction. 
We did so using methods that I would use to classify thousands of stellar explosions, applied to thousands of court cases. 
And in doing so, we built a model that can be applied to other jurisdictions who are willing to explore their biases. 
These collaborations between domain experts and astrophysicists created transformational solutions to help improve people's quality of life. 
But it is a two-way road. 
I bring my astrophysics background to urban science, and I bring what I learn in urban science back to astrophysics. 
Light echoes: the reflections of stellar explosions onto interstellar dust. 
In our images, these reflections appear as white, evanescent, moving features, just like plumes. 
I am adapting the same models that detect plumes in city images to detect light echoes in images of the sky. 
By exploring the things that interest and excite me, reaching outside of my domain, I did turn my restlessness into an asset. 
We, you, all have a unique perspective that can generate new insight and lead to new, unexpected, transformational solutions. 
Thank you. 
(Applause) 

[This is an improvised talk (and intro) based on a suggested topic from the audience. 
The speaker doesn't know the content of the slides.] Moderator: Our next speaker -- (Laughter) is an -- incredibly -- (Laughter) Is an incredibly experienced linguist working at a lab at MIT with a small group of researchers, and through studying our language and the way that we communicate with other people, he has stumbled upon the secret of human intimacy. 
Here to give us his perspective, please welcome to the stage, Anthony Veneziale. 
(Applause) (Laughter) Anthony Veneziale: You might think I know what you're going through. 
You might be looking at me here on the red dot, or you might be looking at me on the screen. 
There's a one sixth of a second delay. 
Did I catch myself? I did. 
I could see myself before I turned, and that small delay creates a little bit of a divide. 
(Laughter) And a divide is exactly what happens with human language, and the processing of that language. 
I of course am working out of a small lab at MIT. 
(Laughter) And we are scraping for every insight that we can get. 
(Laughter) This is not often associated with a computational challenge, but in this case, we found that persistence of vision and auditory intake actually have more in common than we ever realized, and we can see it in this first slide. 
(Laughter) (Applause) Immediately your processing goes to, "Is that a hard-boiled egg?" 
(Laughter) "Is that perhaps the structural integrity of the egg being able to sustain the weight of what seems to be a rock? 
Aha, is it in fact a real rock?" 
We go to questions when we see visual information. 
But when we hear information, this is what happens. 
(Laughter) The floodgates in our mind open much like the streets of Shanghai. 
(Applause) So many pieces of information to process, so many ideas, concepts, feelings and, of course, vulnerabilities that we don't often wish to share. 
And so we hide, and we hide behind what we like to call the floodgate of intimacy. 
(Laughter) And what might that floodgate be holding? 
What is the dike upon which it is built? 
Well, first off -- (Laughter) we found that it's different for six different genotypes. 
(Applause) And, of course, we can start categorizing these genotypes into a neuronormative experience and a neurodiverse experience. 
(Laughter) On the right-hand side of the screen, you're seeing spikes for the neurodiverse thinking. 
Now, there are generally only two emotional states that a neurodiverse brain can tabulate and keep count of at any given time, thereby eliminating the possibility for them to be emotionally, sometimes, attuned to the present situation. 
But on the left-hand side, you can see the neuronormative brain, which can often handle about five different pieces of emotional cognitive information at any given time. 
These are the slight variances that you are seeing in the 75, 90 and 60 percentile, and then of course that dramatic difference of the 25, 40 and 35 percentile. 
(Laughter) But of course, what is the neural network that is helping to bridge and build these different discrepancies? 
(Laughter) Fear. 
(Laughter) (Applause) And as we all know, fear resides in the amygdala, and it is a very natural response, and it is very closely linked with visual perception. 
It is not as closely linked with verbal perception, so our fear receptors often will be going off in advance of any of our cognitive usage around verbal and words and cues of language. 
So as we see these fear moments, we of course are taken aback. 
We stumble in a certain direction, generally away from the intimacy. 
(Laughter) Now of course, there's a difference between the male perception and the female perception and of trans and those who are in between, all of those as well, and outside of the gender spectrum. 
(Laughter) But fear is the central underlying underpinning of all of our response systems. 
Fight-or-flight is one of the earliest, some say reptilian, response to our environment. 
How can we disengage or unhook ourselves from the horns of the amygdala? 
(Laughter) Well, I'd like to tell you the secret right now. 
(Applause) This is all making much, much too much sense. 
(Laughter) The secret lies in turning our backs to one another, and I know that that sounds absolutely like the opposite of what you were expecting, but when in a relationship you turn your back to your partner and place your back upon their back -- (Laughter) you eliminate visual cues. 
(Laughter) (Applause) You are more readily available to failing first, and failing first -- (Laughter) far outweighs the lengths we go to to appeal to others, to our partners and to ourselves. 
We spend billions and billions of dollars on clothing, on makeup, on the latest trend of glasses, but what we don't spend money and time on is connecting with each other in a way that is truthful and honest and stripped of those visual receptors. 
(Applause) (Laughter) It sounds hard, doesn't it? 
(Laughter) But we want to be aggressive about this. 
We don't want to just sit on the couch. 
As a historian said earlier today, it's important to get up and circumvent sometimes that couch. 
And how can we do it? 
Well yes, ice is a big part of it. 
Insights, compassion and empathy: I, C, E. 
(Applause) And when we start using this ice method, well, the possibilities become much bigger than us. 
In fact, they become smaller than you. 
On a molecular level, I believe that that insight is the unifying theme for every talk you have seen so far at TED and will continue as we of course embark on this journey here on this tiny planet, on the ledge, on the precipice, as we are seeing, yes, death is inevitable. 
(Laughter) Will it meet all of us at the same time, I think, is the variable we are inquiring. 
(Laughter) I think that timeline gets a bit longer when we use ice and when we rest our backs upon one another and build together, leaving behind the fear and working towards -- (Laughter) they'll edit this part out -- (Laughter) a ripened experience of love, compassion, intimacy based on a truth that you are sharing from your mind's eye and the heart that we all can touch, tactilely feel, have maybe potentially a mushy experience that we don't just throw out because it is browned, but let us slice in half the experience we have gathered, let us seed what the heart, the core, the seed of that idea in each of us is, and let us share it back to back. 
Thank you very much. 
(Applause) 

I am obsessed with forming healthy communities, and that's why I started Twitch -- to help people watch other people play video games on the internet. 
(Laughter) Thank you for coming to my TED talk. 
(Laughter) So in seriousness, video games and communities truly are quite related. 
From our early human history, we made our entertainment together in small tribes. 
We shared stories around the campfire, we sang together, we danced together. 
Our earliest entertainment was both shared and interactive. 
It wasn't until pretty recently on the grand scale of human history that interactivity took a back seat and broadcast entertainment took over. 
Radio and records brought music into our vehicles, into our homes. 
TV and VHS brought sports and drama into our living rooms. 
This access to broadcast entertainment was unprecedented. 
It gave people amazing content around the globe. 
It created a shared culture for millions of people. 
And now, if you want to go watch or listen to Mozart, you don't have to buy an incredibly expensive ticket and find an orchestra. 
And if you like to sing -- (Sings) I can show you the world -- then you have something in common with people around the world. 
But with this amazing access, we allowed for a separation between creator and consumer, and the relationship between the two became much more one-way. 
We wound up in a world where we had a smaller class of professional creators and most of us became spectators, and as a result it became far easier for us to enjoy that content alone. 
There's a trend counteracting this: scarcity. 
So, Vienna in the 1900s, was famous for its café culture. 
And one of the big drivers of that café culture was expensive newspapers that were hard to get, and as a result, people would go to the café and read the shared copy there. 
And once they're in the cafe, they meet the other people also reading the same newspaper, they converse, they exchange ideas and they form a community. 
In a similar way, TV and cable used to be more expensive, and so you might not watch the game at home. 
Instead you'd go to the local bar and cheer along with your fellow sports fans there. 
But as the price of media continues to fall over time thanks to technology, this shared necessity that used to bring our communities together falls away. 
We have so many amazing options for our entertainment, and yet it's easier than ever for us to wind up consuming those options alone. 
Our communities are bearing the consequences. 
For example, the number of people who report having at least two close friends is at an all-time low. 
I believe that one of the major contributing causes to this is that our entertainment today allows us to be separate. 
There is one trend reversing this atomization of our society: modern multiplayer video games. 
Games are like a shared campfire. 
They're both interactive and connecting. 
Now these campfires may have beautiful animations, heroic quests, occasionally too many loot boxes, but games today are very different than the solitary activity of 20 years ago. 
They're deeply complex, they're more intellectually stimulating, and most of all, they're intrinsically social. 
One of the recent breakout genres exemplifying this change is the battle royale. 
100 people parachute onto an island in a last-man-standing competition. 
Think of it as being kind of like "American Idol," but with a lot more fighting and a lot less Simon Cowell. 
You may have heard of "Fortnite," which is a breakout example of the battle royale genre, which has been played by more than 250 million people around the world. 
It's everyone from kids in your neighborhood to Drake and Ellen DeGeneres. 
2.3 billion people in the world play video games. 
Early games like "Tetris" and "Mario" may have been simple puzzles or quests, but with the rise of arcades and then internet play, and now massively multiplayer games of huge, thriving online communities, games have emerged as the one form of entertainment where consumption truly requires human connection. 
So this brings us to streaming. 
Why do people stream themselves playing video games? 
And why do hundreds of millions of people around the world congregate to watch them? 
I want you all the imagine for second -- imagine you land on an alien planet, and on this planet, there's a giant green rectangle. 
And in this green rectangle, aliens in matching outfits are trying to push a checkered sphere between two posts using only their feet. 
It's pretty evenly matched, so the ball is just going back and forth, but there's hundreds of millions of people watching from home anyway, and cheering and getting excited and engaged right along with them. 
Now I grew up watching sports with my dad, so I get why soccer is entertaining and engaging. 
But if you don't watch sports, maybe you like watching "Dancing with the Stars" or you enjoy "Top Chef." 
Regardless, the principle is the same. 
If there is an activity that you really enjoy, you're probably going to like watching other people do it with skill and panache. 
It might be perplexing to an alien, but bonding over shared passion is a human universal. 
So gamers grew up expecting this live, interactive entertainment, and passive consumption just doesn't feel as fulfilling. 
That's why livestreaming has taken off with video games. 
Because livestreaming offers that same kind of interactive feeling. 
So when you imagine what's happening on Twitch, I don't want you to think of a million livestreams of video games. 
Instead, what I want you to picture is millions of campfires. 
Some of them are bonfires -- huge, roaring bonfires with hundreds of thousands of people around them. 
Some of them are smaller, more intimate community gatherings where everyone knows your name. 
Let's try taking a seat by one of those campfires right now. 
Hey Cohh, how's it going? 
Cohh: Hey, how's it going, Emmett? 
ES: So I'm here at TED with about 1,000 of my closest friends, and we thought we'd come and join you guys for a little stream. 
Cohh: Awesome! It's great to hear from you guys. 
ES: So Cohh, can you share with the TED audience here -- what have you learned about your community on Twitch? 
Cohh: Ah, man, where to begin? 
I've been doing this for over five years now, and if there's one thing that doesn't cease to impress me on the daily, it's just kind of how incredible this whole thing is for communication. 
I've been playing games for 20 years of my life, I've led online MMO guilds for over 10, and it's the kind of thing where there's very few places in life where you can go to meet so many people with similar interests. 
I was listening in a bit earlier; I love the campfire analogy, I actually use a similar one. 
I see it all as a bunch of people on a big couch but only one person has the controller. 
So it's kind of like a "Pass the snack!" situation, you know? 
700 people that way -- but it's great and really it's just -- ES: So Cohh, what is going on in chat right now? 
Can you explain that a little bit to us? 
Because my eyesight isn't that good but I see a lot of emotes. 
Cohh: So this is my community; this is the Cohhilition. 
I stream every single day. 
I actually just wrapped up a 2,000-day challenge, and as such, we have developed a pretty incredible community here in the channel. 
Right now we have about 6200 people with us. 
What you're seeing is a spam of "Hello, TED" good-vibe emotes, love emotes, "this is awesome," "Hi, guys," "Hi, everyone." 
Basically just a huge collection of people -- huge collection of gamers that are all just experiencing a positive event together. 
ES: So is there anything that -- can we poll chat? 
I want ask chat a question. 
Is there anything that chat would like the world, and particularly these people here with me at TED right now, to know about what they get out of playing video games and being part of this community? 
Cohh: Oh, wow. 
I am already starting to see a lot of answers here. 
"I like the good vibes." 
"Best communities are on Twitch." 
(Laughter) "They get us through the rough patches in life." 
Oh, that's a message I definitely see a lot on Twitch, which is very good. 
"A very positive community," "a lot of positivity," which is pretty great. 
ES: So Cohh, before I get back to my TED talk, which I actually should probably get back to doing at some point -- (Laughter) Do you have anything else that you want to share with me or any question you wanted to ask, you've always wanted to get out there before an audience? 
Cohh: Honestly, not too much. 
I mean, I absolutely love what you're doing right now. 
I think that the interactive streaming is the big unexplored frontier of the future in entertainment, and thank you for doing everything you're doing up there. 
The more people that hear about what you do, the better -- for everyone on here. 
ES: Awesome, Cohh. Thanks so much. 
I'm going to get back to giving this talk now, but we should catch up later. 
Cohh: Sounds great! 
(Applause) ES: So that was a new way to interact. 
We could influence what happened on the stream, we could cocreate the experience along with him, and we really had a multiplayer experience with chat and with Cohh. 
At Twitch, we've started calling this, as a result, "multiplayer entertainment." 
Because going from watching a video alone to watching a live interactive stream is similar to the difference between going from playing a single-player game to playing a multiplayer game. 
Gamers are often as the forefront of exploration in new technology. 
Microcomputers, for example, were used early on for video games, and the very first handheld, digital mass-market devices weren't cell phones, they were Gameboys ... 
for video games. 
And as a result, one way that you can get a hint of what the future might hold is to look to this fun, interactive sandbox of video games and ask yourself, "what are these gamers doing today?" 
And that might give you a hint as to what the future is going to hold for all of us. 
One of the things we're already seeing on Twitch is multiplayer entertainment coming to sports. 
So, Twitch and the NFL teamed up to offer livestreaming football, but instead of network announcers in suits streaming the game, we got Twitch users to come in and stream it themselves on their own channel and interact with their community and make it a real multiplayer experience. 
So I actually think that if you look out into the future -- only hundreds of people today get to be sports announcers. 
It's a tiny, tiny number of people who have that opportunity. 
But sports are about to go multiplayer, and that means that anyone who wants to around the world is going to get the opportunity to become a sports announcer, to give it a shot. 
And I think that's going to unlock incredible amounts of new talent for all of us. 
And we're not going to be asking, "Did you catch the game?" 
Instead, we're going to be asking, "Whose channel did you catch the game on?" 
We already see this happening with cooking, with singing -- we even see people streaming welding. 
And all of this stuff is going to happen around the metaphorical campfire. 
There's going to be millions of these campfires lit over the next few years. 
And on every topic, you're going to be able to find a campfire that will allow you to bond with your people around the world. 
For most of human history, entertainment was simply multiplayer. 
We sang together in person, we shared news together in the town square in person, and somewhere along the way, that two-way conversation turned into a one-way transmission. 
As someone who cares about communities, I am excited for a world where our entertainment could connect us instead of isolating us. 
A world where we can bond with each other over our shared interests and create real, strong communities. 
Games, streams and the interactions they encourage, are only just beginning to turn the wheel back to our interactive, community-rich, multiplayer past. 
Thank you all for sharing this experience here with me, and may you all find your best campfire. 
(Applause) 

No other organ, perhaps no other object in human life, is as imbued with metaphor and meaning as the human heart. 
Over the course of history, the heart has been a symbol of our emotional lives. 
It was considered by many to be the seat of the soul, the repository of the emotions. 
The very word "emotion" stems in part from the French verb "émouvoir," meaning "to stir up." 
And perhaps it's only logical that emotions would be linked to an organ characterized by its agitated movement. 
But what is this link? 
Is it real or purely metaphorical? 
As a heart specialist, I am here today to tell you that this link is very real. 
Emotions, you will learn, can and do have a direct physical effect on the human heart. 
But before we get into this, let's talk a bit about the metaphorical heart. 
The symbolism of the emotional heart endures even today. 
If we ask people which image they most associate with love, there's no question that the Valentine heart would the top the list. 
The heart shape, called a cardioid, is common in nature. 
It's found in the leaves, flowers and seeds of many plants, including silphium, which was used for birth control in the Middle Ages and perhaps is the reason why the heart became associated with sex and romantic love. 
Whatever the reason, hearts began to appear in paintings of lovers in the 13th century. 
Over time, the pictures came to be colored red, the color of blood, a symbol of passion. 
In the Roman Catholic Church, the heart shape became known as the Sacred Heart of Jesus. 
Adorned with thorns and emitting ethereal light, it became an insignia of monastic love. 
This association between the heart and love has withstood modernity. 
When Barney Clark, a retired dentist with end-stage heart failure, received the first permanent artificial heart in Utah in 1982, his wife of 39 years reportedly asked the doctors, "Will he still be able to love me?" 
Today, we know that the heart is not the source of love or the other emotions, per se; the ancients were mistaken. 
And yet, more and more, we have come to understand that the connection between the heart and the emotions is a highly intimate one. 
The heart may not originate our feelings, but it is highly responsive to them. 
In a sense, a record of our emotional life is written on our hearts. 
Fear and grief, for example, can cause profound cardiac injury. 
The nerves that control unconscious processes such as the heartbeat can sense distress and trigger a maladaptive fight-or-flight response that triggers blood vessels to constrict, the heart to gallop and blood pressure to rise, resulting in damage. 
In other words, it is increasingly clear that our hearts are extraordinarily sensitive to our emotional system, to the metaphorical heart, if you will. 
There is a heart disorder first recognized about two decades ago called "takotsubo cardiomyopathy," or "the broken heart syndrome," in which the heart acutely weakens in response to intense stress or grief, such as after a romantic breakup or the death of a loved one. 
As these pictures show, the grieving heart in the middle looks very different than the normal heart on the left. 
It appears stunned and frequently balloons into the distinctive shape of a takotsubo, shown on the right, a Japanese pot with a wide base and a narrow neck. 
We don't know exactly why this happens, and the syndrome usually resolves within a few weeks. 
However, in the acute period, it can cause heart failure, life-threatening arrhythmias, even death. 
For example, the husband of an elderly patient of mine had died recently. 
She was sad, of course, but accepting. 
Maybe even a bit relieved. 
It had been a very long illness; he'd had dementia. 
But a week after the funeral, she looked at his picture and became tearful. 
And then she developed chest pain, and with it, came shortness of breath, distended neck veins, a sweaty brow, a noticeable panting as she was sitting up in a chair -- all signs of heart failure. 
She was admitted to the hospital, where an ultrasound confirmed what we already suspected: her heart had weakened to less than half its normal capacity and had ballooned into the distinctive shape of a takotsubo. 
But no other tests were amiss, no sign of clogged arteries anywhere. 
Two weeks later, her emotional state had returned to normal and so, an ultrasound confirmed, had her heart. 
Takotsubo cardiomyopathy has been linked to many stressful situations, including public speaking -- (Laughter) (Applause) domestic disputes, gambling losses, even a surprise birthday party. 
(Laughter) It's even been associated with widespread social upheaval, such as after a natural disaster. 
For example, in 2004, a massive earthquake devastated a district on the largest island in Japan. 
More than 60 people were killed, and thousands were injured. 
On the heels of this catastrophe, researchers found that the incidents of takotsubo cardiomyopathy increased twenty-four-fold in the district one month after the earthquake, compared to a similar period the year before. 
The residences of these cases closely correlated with the intensity of the tremor. 
In almost every case, patients lived near the epicenter. 
Interestingly, takotsubo cardiomyopathy has been seen after a happy event, too, but the heart appears to react differently, ballooning in the midportion, for example, and not at the apex. 
Why different emotional precipitants would result in different cardiac changes remains a mystery. 
But today, perhaps as an ode to our ancient philosophers, we can say that even if emotions are not contained inside our hearts, the emotional heart overlaps its biological counterpart, in surprising and mysterious ways. 
Heart syndromes, including sudden death, have long been reported in individuals experiencing intense emotional disturbance or turmoil in their metaphorical hearts. 
In 1942, the Harvard physiologist Walter Cannon published a paper called "'Voodoo' Death," in which he described cases of death from fright in people who believed they had been cursed, such as by a witch doctor or as a consequence of eating taboo fruit. 
In many cases, the victim, all hope lost, dropped dead on the spot. 
What these cases had in common was the victim's absolute belief that there was an external force that could cause their demise, and against which they were powerless to fight. 
This perceived lack of control, Cannon postulated, resulted in an unmitigated physiological response, in which blood vessels constricted to such a degree that blood volume acutely dropped, blood pressure plummeted, the heart acutely weakened, and massive organ damage resulted from a lack of transported oxygen. 
Cannon believed that voodoo deaths were limited to indigenous or "primitive" people. 
But over the years, these types of deaths have been shown to occur in all manner of modern people, too. 
Today, death by grief has been seen in spouses and in siblings. 
Broken hearts are literally and figuratively deadly. 
These associations hold true even for animals. 
In a fascinating study in 1980 published in the journal "Science," researchers fed caged rabbits a high-cholesterol diet to study its effect on cardiovascular disease. 
Surprisingly, they found that some rabbits developed a lot more disease than others, but they couldn't explain why. 
The rabbits had very similar diet, environment and genetic makeup. 
They thought it might have something to do with how frequently the technician interacted with the rabbits. 
So they repeated the study, dividing the rabbits into two groups. 
Both groups were fed a high-cholesterol diet. 
But in one group, the rabbits were removed from their cages, held, petted, talked to, played with, and in the other group, the rabbits remained in their cages and were left alone. 
At one year, on autopsy, the researchers found that the rabbits in the first group, that received human interaction, had 60 percent less aortic disease than rabbits in the other group, despite having similar cholesterol levels, blood pressure and heart rate. 
Today, the care of the heart has become less the province of philosophers, who dwell upon the heart's metaphorical meanings, and more the domain of doctors like me, wielding technologies that even a century ago, because of the heart's exalted status in human culture, were considered taboo. 
In the process, the heart has been transformed from an almost supernatural object imbued with metaphor and meaning into a machine that can be manipulated and controlled. 
But this is the key point: these manipulations, we now understand, must be complemented by attention to the emotional life that the heart, for thousands of years, was believed to contain. 
Consider, for example, the Lifestyle Heart Trial, published in the British journal "The Lancet" in 1990. 
Forty-eight patients with moderate or severe coronary disease were randomly assigned to usual care or an intensive lifestyle that included a low-fat vegetarian diet, moderate aerobic exercise, group psychosocial support and stress management advice. 
The researchers found that the lifestyle patients had a nearly five percent reduction in coronary plaque. 
Control patients, on the other hand, had five percent more coronary plaque at one year and 28 percent more at five years. 
They also had nearly double the rate of cardiac events, like heart attacks, coronary bypass surgery and cardiac-related deaths. 
Now, here's an interesting fact: some patients in the control group adopted diet and exercise plans that were nearly as intense as those in the intensive lifestyle group. 
Their heart disease still progressed. 
Diet and exercise alone were not enough to facilitate coronary disease regression. 
At both one- and five-year follow-ups, stress management was more strongly correlated with reversal of coronary disease than exercise was. 
No doubt, this and similar studies are small, and, of course, correlation does not prove causation. 
It's certainly possible that stress leads to unhealthy habits, and that's the real reason for the increased cardiovascular risk. 
But as with the association of smoking and lung cancer, when so many studies show the same thing, and when there are mechanisms to explain a causal relationship, it seems capricious to deny that one probably exists. 
What many doctors have concluded is what I, too, have learned in my nearly two decades as a heart specialist: the emotional heart intersects with its biological counterpart in surprising and mysterious ways. 
And yet, medicine today continues to conceptualize the heart as a machine. 
This conceptualization has had great benefits. 
Cardiology, my field, is undoubtedly one of the greatest scientific success stories of the past 100 years. 
Stents, pacemakers, defibrillators, coronary bypass surgery, heart transplants -- all these things were developed or invented after World War II. 
However, it's possible that we are approaching the limits of what scientific medicine can do to combat heart disease. 
Indeed, the rate of decline of cardiovascular mortality has slowed significantly in the past decade. 
We will need to shift to a new paradigm to continue to make the kind of progress to which we have become accustomed. 
In this paradigm, psychosocial factors will need to be front and center in how we think about heart problems. 
This is going to be an uphill battle, and it remains a domain that is largely unexplored. 
The American Heart Association still does not list emotional stress as a key modifiable risk factor for heart disease, perhaps in part because blood cholesterol is so much easier to lower than emotional and social disruption. 
There is a better way, perhaps, if we recognize that when we say "a broken heart," we are indeed sometimes talking about a real broken heart. 
We must, must pay more attention to the power and importance of the emotions in taking care of our hearts. 
Emotional stress, I have learned, is often a matter of life and death. 
Thank you. 
(Applause) 

Between 2004 and 2008, I unsuccessfully tried to get into the Kenyan music industry. 
But the recurring answer from producers was I was not Kenyan enough. 
Meaning what? 
I didn't sing fully in the slang derivative of Kiswahili and I didn't sing enough party tracks, so they said Kenyans wouldn't listen to a Kenyan who sounded like me. 
This idea of otherism, the exclusion of a person based on their perceived deviation from the norms, goes to the root of the problems in Kenya. 
And it runs deep. 
Kenya was invented by colonialists in 1895, and with it, came the erasure of our identity and the class system built on otherism. 
So by 1963, when we received our independence, these ideas had already become the new normal. 
Now, we've tried a lot of different ways to move forward since. 
We have a common language, currency, infrastructure, basically all the things that make a country a country. 
But all these efforts at nation-building do not go to the heart of the matter. 
Which is this: we cannot build what we do not truly love. 
And we cannot love until we love ourselves. 
The thing we have to heal, us Kenyans, is our lack of self-love, our deep self-hate and our existential identity crisis. 
And this is the work of nation-building that only the creative industry can do. 
The idea that Kenya can only include some of us led me to found a music festival in 2008 called Blankets and Wine, to give a platform to myself and other misfits. 
Ten years later, we've programmed over 200 bands and put at least 100,000 dollars directly into the hands of artists and managers, who have in turn spent it on technicians, rehearsals, music videos and other things along the music value chain. 
Our platform has allowed for multiple Kenyan identities to exist, while inspiring the industry to discover and engage the wide variety of Kenyan music. 
What we do is necessary but insufficient. 
And we must urgently pivot into a live music circuit. 
But there are other ways music can help heal the nation. 
According to a 2018 state of media report, traditional radio is sill by far the biggest distributor of ideas in Kenya, with 47 percent of Kenyans still choosing radio first. 
This presents an opportunity. 
We can use radio to help Kenyans hear the diversity that is Kenya. 
We can reserve 60 percent of all programing on Kenyan radio for Kenyan music. 
We can break down ethnic barriers by playing Kenyan music done in English, Kiswahili and other ethnic languages, on what is now single-language ethnic radio. 
Radio can help stimulate interest and demand for Kenyan music by Kenyans, while also providing the much-needed incomes by way of royalties. 
But more importantly, radio can help us build a more inclusive narrative about Kenya. 
For you cannot love what you do not know exists. 
Other creative industries too can do the work. 
When you consider that 41 percent of Kenyans still choose TV as their primary medium, it's obvious that film has a huge potential. 
The meager resources that have been put into the sector have already produced world-class acts, like Lupita Nyong'o and Wanuri Kahiu, but we are going to need a lot more incentives and investments to make filming in Kenya easier, so more Kenyan stories can get on the Kenyan TV and spark off the really difficult conversations we need to have with one another. 
We're going to need to grow a lot more home-grown stars, so we can reverse the idea that we have to blow up abroad before we get the acceptance and validation of home. 
Fashion too can do the work. 
We need to make it possible to affordably mass-produce Kenyan clothes for Kenyan consumers, so we don't all have to rely on second-hand imports. 
The first running shoe made in Kenya needs to be a local and global success as an ode to Kenyan excellence, epitomized by Kenyan runners, who are literally world-class. 
For these ideas to come to life, jobs will be created, and Kenyan ideas will be exported. 
But more importantly, Kenyans may finally consider themselves worthy of the love that we reserve for others. 
Kenya's creative industry is dynamic, cosmopolitan, forward-looking, and without a doubt, a true manufacturing industry of the immediate future. 
But its true power lies in its ability to help heal the psyche of Kenya, so we can finally build a nation for real. 
Thank you. 
(Applause) (Applause) For this song, I'd like us all to take a minute and think about immigrant communities, and especially refugee immigrant communities, and the daily struggle they have to endure, building a life with dignity and meaning away from everything they have loved and known. 
If you feel any empathy for this idea, I ask to see your fist up in the air with me.

And it's about female friendship and female power.

Spoons. 
Cardboard boxes. 
Toddler-size electric trains. 
Holiday ornaments. 
Bounce houses. 
Blankets. 
Baskets. 
Carpets. 
Tray tables. 
Smartphones. 
Pianos. 
Robes. 
Photographs. 
What do all of these things have in common, aside from the fact they're photos that I took in the last three months, and therefore, own the copyright to? 
(Laughter) They're all inventions that were created with the benefit of language. 
None of these things would have existed without language. 
Imagine creating any one of those things or, like, building an entire building like this, without being able to use language or without benefiting from any knowledge that was got by the use of language. 
Basically, language is the most important thing in the entire world. 
All of our civilization rests upon it. 
And those who devote their lives to studying it -- both how language emerged, how human languages differ, how they differ from animal communication systems -- are linguists. 
Formal linguistics is a relatively young field, more or less. 
And it's uncovered a lot of really important stuff. 
Like, for example, that human communication systems differ crucially from animal communication systems, that all languages are equally expressive, even if they do it in different ways. 
And yet, despite this, there are a lot of people who just love to pop off about language like they have an equal understanding of it as a linguist, because, of course, they speak a language. 
And if you speak a language, that means you have just as much right to talk about its function as anybody else. 
Imagine if you were talking to a surgeon, and you say, "Listen, buddy. 
I've had a heart for, like, 40 years now. 
I think I know a thing or two about aortic valve replacements. 
I think my opinion is just as valid as yours." 
And yet, that's exactly what happens. 
This is Neil deGrasse Tyson, saying that in the film "Arrival," he would have brought a cryptographer -- somebody who can unscramble a message in a language they already know -- rather than a linguist, to communicate with the aliens, because what would a linguist -- why would that be useful in talking to somebody speaking a language we don't even know? 
Though, of course, the "Arrival" film is not off the hook. 
I mean, come on -- listen, film. Hey, buddy: there are aliens that come down to our planet in gigantic ships, and they want to do nothing except for communicate with us, and you hire one linguist? 
(Laughter) What's the US government on a budget or something? 
(Laughter) A lot of these things can be chalked up to misunderstandings, both about what language is and about the formal study of language, about linguistics. 
And I think there's something that underlies a lot of these misunderstandings that can be summed up by this delightful article in "Forbes," about why high school students shouldn't learn foreign languages. 
I'm going to pull out some quotes from this, and I want you to see if you can figure out what underlies some of these opinions and ideas. 
"Americans rarely read the classics, even in translation." 
So in other words, why bother learning a foreign language when they're not even going to read the classic in the original anyway? 
What's the point? 
"Studying foreign languages in school is a waste of time, compared to other things that you could be doing in school." 
"Europe has a lot of language groups clustered in a relatively small space." 
So for Americans, ah, what's the point of learning another language? 
You're not really going to get a lot of bang for your buck out of that. 
This is my favorite, "A student in Birmingham would have to travel about a thousand miles to get to the Mexican border, and even then, there would be enough people who speak English to get around." 
In other words, if you can kind of wave your arms around, and you can get to where you're going, then there's really no point in learning another language anyway. 
What underlies a lot of these attitudes is the conceptual metaphor, language is a tool. 
And there's something that rings very true about this metaphor. 
Language is kind of a tool in that, if you know the local language, you can do more than if you didn't. 
But the implication is that language is only a tool, and this is absolutely false. 
If language was a tool, it would honestly be a pretty poor tool. 
And we would have abandoned it long ago for something that was a lot better. 
Think about just any sentence. 
Here's a sentence that I'm sure I've said in my life: "Yesterday I saw Kyn." 
I have a friend named Kyn. 
And when I say this sentence, "Yesterday I saw Kyn," do you think it's really the case that everything in my mind is now implanted in your mind via this sentence? 
Hardly, because there's a lot of other stuff going on. 
Like, when I say "yesterday," I might think what the weather was like yesterday because I was there. 
And if I'm remembering, I'll probably remember there was something I forgot to mail, which I did. 
This was a preplanned joke, but I really did forget to mail something. 
And so that means I'm going to have to do it Monday, because that's when I'm going to get back home. 
And of course, when I think of Monday, I'll think of "Manic Monday" by the Bangles. It's a good song. 
And when I say the word "saw," I think of this phrase: "'I see!' said the blind man as he picked up his hammer and saw." 
I always do. 
Anytime I hear the word "saw" or say it, I always think of that, because my grandfather always used to say it, so it makes me think of my grandfather. 
And we're back to "Manic Monday" again, for some reason. 
And with Kyn, when I'm saying something like, "Yesterday I saw Kyn," I'll think of the circumstances under which I saw him. 
And this happened to be that day. Here he is with my cat. 
And of course, if I'm thinking of Kyn, I'll think he's going to Long Beach State right now, and I'll remember that my good friend John and my mother both graduated from Long Beach State, my cousin Katie is going to Long Beach State right now. 
And it's "Manic Monday" again. 
But this is just a fraction of what's going on in your head at any given time while you are speaking. 
And all we have to represent the entire mess that is going on in our head, is this. 
I mean, that's all we got. 
(Laughter) Is it any wonder that our system is so poor? 
So imagine, if I can give you an analogy, imagine if you wanted to know what is it like to eat a cake, if instead of just eating the cake, you instead had to ingest the ingredients of a cake, one by one, along with instructions about how these ingredients can be combined to form a cake. 
You had to eat the instructions, too. 
(Laughter) If that was how we had to experience cake, we would never eat cake. 
And yet, language is the only way -- the only way -- that we can figure out what is going on here, in our minds. 
This is our interiority, the thing that makes us human, the thing that makes us different from other animals, is all inside here somewhere, and all we have to do to represent it is our own languages. 
A language is our best way of showing what's going on in our head. 
Imagine if I wanted to ask a big question, like: "What is the nature of human thought and emotion?" 
What you'd want to do is you'd want to examine as many different languages as possible. 
One isn't just going to do it. 
To give you an example, here's a picture I took of little Roman, that I took with a 12-megapixel camera. 
Now, here's that same picture with a lot fewer pixels. 
Obviously, neither of these pictures is a real cat. 
But one gives you a lot better sense of what a cat is than the other. 
Language is not merely a tool. 
It is our legacy, it's our way of conveying what it means to be human. 
And of course, by "our" legacy, I mean all humans everywhere. 
And losing even one language makes that picture a lot less clear. 
So as a job for the past 10 years and also as recreation, just for fun, I create languages. 
These are called "conlangs," short for "constructed languages." 
Now, presenting these facts back to back, that we're losing languages on our planet and that I create brand-new languages, you might think that there's some nonsuperficial connection between these two. 
In fact, a lot of people have drawn a line between those dots. 
This is a guy who got all bent out of shape that there was a conlang in James Cameron's "Avatar." 
He says, "But in the three years it took James Cameron to get Avatar to the screen, a language died." 
Probably a lot more than that, actually. 
"Na'vi, alas, won't fill the hole where it used to be ..." 
A truly profound and poignant statement -- if you don't think about it at all. 
(Laughter) But when I was here at Cal, I completed two majors. 
One of them was linguistics, but the other one was English. 
And of course, the English major, the study of English, is not actually the study of the English language, as we know, it's the study of literature. 
Literature is just a wonderful thing, because basically, literature, more broadly, is kind of like art; it falls under the rubric of art. 
And what we do with literature, authors create new, entire beings and histories. 
And it's interesting to us to see what kind of depth and emotion and just unique spirit authors can invest into these fictional beings. 
So much so, that, I mean -- take a look at this. 
There's an entire series of books that are written about fictional characters. 
Like, the entire book is just about one fictional, fake human being. 
There's an entire book on George F. Babbitt from Sinclair Lewis's "Babbitt," and I guarantee you, that book is longer than "Babbitt," which is a short book. 
Does anybody even remember that one? 
It's pretty good, I actually think it's better than "Main Street." 
That's my hot take. 
So we've never questioned the fact that literature is interesting. 
But despite the fact, not even linguists are actually interested in what created languages can tell us about the depth of the human spirit just as an artistic endeavor. 
I'll give you a nice little example here. 
There was an article written about me in the California alumni magazine a while back. 
And when they wrote this article, they wanted to get somebody from the opposing side, which, in hindsight, seems like a weird thing to do. 
You're just talking about a person, and you want to get somebody from the opposing side of that person. 
(Laughter) Essentially, this is just a puff piece, but whatever. 
So, they happened to get one of the most brilliant linguists of our time, George Lakoff, who's a linguist here at Berkeley. 
And his work has basically forever changed the fields of linguistics and cognitive science. 
And when asked about my work and about language creation in general, he said, "But there's a lot of things to be done in the study of language. 
You should spend the time on something real." 
Yeah. 
"Something real." Does this remind you of anything? 
To use the very framework that he himself invented, let me refer back to this conceptual metaphor: language is a tool. 
And he appears to be laboring under this conceptual metaphor; that is, language is useful when it can be used for communication. 
Language is useless when it can't be used for communication. 
It might make you wonder: What do we do with dead languages? 
But anyway. 
So, because of this idea, it might seem like the very height of absurdity to have a Duolingo course on the High Valyrian language that I created for HBO's "Game of Thrones." 
You might wonder what, exactly, are 740,000 people learning? 
(Laughter) Well, let's take a look at it. 
What are they learning? 
What could they possibly be learning? 
Well, bearing in mind that the other language for this -- it's for people that speak English -- English speakers are learning quite a bit. 
Here's a sentence that they will probably never use for communication in their entire lives: "Vala ābre urnes." 
"The man sees the woman." 
The little middle line is the gloss, so it's word for word, that's what it says. 
And they're actually learning some very fascinating things, especially if they're English speakers. 
They're learning that a verb can come at the very end of a sentence. 
Doesn't really do that in English when you have two arguments. 
They're learning that sometimes a language doesn't have an equivalent for the word "the" -- it's totally absent. 
That's something language can do. 
They're learning that a long vowel can actually be longer in duration, as opposed to different in quality, which is what our long vowels do; they're actually the same length. 
They're learning that there are these little inflections. 
Hmm? Hmm? 
There are inflections called "cases" on the end of nouns -- (Laughter) that tell you who does what to whom in a sentence. 
Even if you leave the order of the words the same and switch the endings, it changes who does what to whom. 
What they're learning is that languages do things, the same things, differently. 
And that learning languages can be fun. 
What they're learning is respect for Language: capital "L" Language. 
And given the fact that 88 percent of Americans only speak English at home, I don't think that's necessarily a bad thing. 
You know why languages die on our planet? 
It's not because government imposes one language on a smaller group, or because an entire group of speakers is wiped out. 
That certainly has happened in the past, and it's happening now, but it's not the main reason. 
The main reason is that a child is born to a family that speaks a language that is not widely spoken in their community, and that child doesn't learn it. 
Why? 
Because that language is not valued in their community. 
Because the language isn't useful. 
Because the child can't go and get a job if they speak that language. 
Because if language is just a tool, then learning their native language is about as useful as learning High Valyrian, so why bother? 
Now ... 
Maybe language study isn't going to lead to a lot more linguistic fluency. 
But maybe that's not such a big deal. 
Maybe if more people are studying more languages, it will lead to more linguistic tolerance and less linguistic imperialism. 
Maybe if we actually respect language for what it is -- literally, the greatest invention in the history of humankind -- then in the future, we can celebrate endangered languages as living languages, as opposed to museum pieces. 
(High Valyrian) Kirimvose. Thank you. 
(Applause) 

So in 2011, someone broke into my sister's office at the university where she teaches in Nigeria. 
Now thankfully, the person was caught, arrested and charged to court. 
When I get into court, the clerks who were assigned to my sister's case informed her that they wouldn't be able to process the paperwork unless she paid a bribe. 
Now, at first she thought it was part of a practical joke. 
But then she realized they were serious. 
And then she became furious. 
I mean, think about it: here she was, the recent victim of a crime, with the very people who were supposed to help her, and they were demanding a bribe from her. 
That's just one of the many ways that corruption impacts millions of people in my country. 
You know, growing up in Nigeria, corruption permeated virtually every element of the society. 
Reports of politicians embezzling millions of dollars were common. 
Police officers stealing money or extorting money from everyday hardworking citizens was routine practice. 
I felt that development could never actually happen, so long as corruption persisted. 
But over the past several years, in my research on innovation and prosperity, I've learned that corruption is actually not the problem hindering our development. 
In fact, conventional thinking on corruption and its relationship to development is not only wrong, but it's holding many poor countries backwards. 
So, the thinking goes like this: in a society that's poor and corrupt, our best shot at reducing corruption is to create good laws, enforce them well, and this will make way for development and innovation to flourish. 
Now, it makes sense on paper, which is why many governments and development organizations invest billions of dollars annually on institutional reform and anti-corruption programs. 
But many of these programs fail to reduce corruption, because we have the equation backwards. 
You see, societies don't develop because they've reduced corruption. 
They're able to reduce corruption because they've developed. 
And societies develop through investments in innovation. 
Now, at first, I thought this was impossible. 
Why would anyone in their right mind invest in a society where, at least on the surface, it seems a terrible place to do business? 
You know, a society where politicians are corrupt and consumers are poor? 
But then, the more I learned about the relationship between innovation and corruption, the more I started to see things differently. 
Here's how this played out in sub-Saharan Africa as the region developed its telecommunications industry. 
In the late 1990s, fewer than five percent of people in sub-Saharan Africa had phones. 
In Nigeria, for example, the country had more than 110 million people but fewer than half a million phones in the whole nation. 
Now, this scarcity fueled widespread corruption in the industry. 
I mean, public officials who worked for the state-owned phone companies demanded bribes from people who wanted phones. 
And because most people couldn't afford to pay the bribes, phones were only available to those who were wealthy. 
Then an entrepreneur named Mo Ibrahim decided that he would set up a telecommunications company on the continent. 
Now, when he told his colleagues about his idea, they just laughed at him. 
But Mo Ibrahim was undeterred. 
And so in 1998, he set up Celtel. 
The company provided affordable mobile phones and cell service to millions of Africans, in some of the poorest and most corrupt countries in the region -- I mean countries such as Congo, Malawi, Sierra Leone and Uganda. 
You see, in our research, we call what Mo Ibrahim built a "market-creating innovation." 
Market-creating innovations transform complicated and expensive products into products that are simple and affordable, so that many more people in society could access them. 
Now in this case, phones were expensive before Celtel made them much more affordable. 
As other investors -- some of his colleagues, actually -- saw that it was possible to create a successful mobile phone company on the continent, they flooded in with billions of dollars of investments. 
And this led to significant growth in the industry. 
From barely nothing in 2000, today, virtually every African country now has a vibrant mobile telecommunications industry. 
The sector now supports close to one billion phone connections, it has created nearly four million jobs and generates billions of dollars in taxes every year. 
These are taxes that governments can now reinvest into the economy to build their institutions. 
And here's the thing: because most people no longer have to bribe public officials just to get a phone, corruption -- at least within this industry -- has reduced. 
Now, if Mo Ibrahim had waited for corruption to be fixed in all of sub-Saharan Africa before he invested, he would still be waiting today. 
You know, most people who engage in corruption know they shouldn't. 
I mean, the public officials who were demanding bribes from people to get phones and the people who were paying the bribes -- they knew they were breaking the law. 
But they did it anyways. 
The question is: Why? 
The answer? 
Scarcity. 
See, whenever people would benefit from gaining access to something that scarce, this makes corruption attractive. 
You know, in poor countries, we complain a lot about corrupt politicians who embezzle state funds. 
But in many of those countries, economic opportunity is scarce, and so corruption becomes an attractive way to gain wealth. 
We also complain about civil servants like police officers, who extort money from everyday hardworking citizens. 
But most civil servants are grossly underpaid and are leading desperate lives. 
And so for them, extortion or corruption is a good way to make a living. 
You know, this phenomenon also plays itself out in wealthy countries as well. 
When rich parents bribe university officials -- (Laughter) When rich parents bribe university officials so their children can gain admission into elite colleges, the circumstance is different, but the principle is the same. 
I mean, admission into elite colleges is scarce, and so bribery becomes attractive. 
The thing is, I'm not trying to say there shouldn't be things that are scarce in society or things that are selective. 
What I'm just trying to explain is this relationship between corruption and scarcity. 
And in most poor countries, way too many basic things are scarce. 
I mean things like food, education, health care, economic opportunity, jobs. 
This creates the perfect breeding ground for corruption to thrive. 
Now, in no way does this excuse corrupt behavior. 
It just helps us understand it a bit better. 
Investing in businesses that make things affordable and accessible to so many more people attacks this scarcity and creates the revenues for governments to reinvest in their economies. 
Now, when this happens on a countrywide level, it can revolutionize nations. 
Consider the impact in South Korea. 
Now, in the 1950s, South Korea was a desperately poor country, and it was very corrupt. 
The country was ruled by an authoritarian government and engaged in bribery and embezzlement. 
In fact, economists at the time said South Korea was trapped in poverty, and they referred to it as "an economic basket case." 
When you looked at South Korea's institutions, even as late as the 1980s, they were on par with some of the poorest and most corrupt African countries at the time. 
But as companies like Samsung, Kia, Hyundai invested in innovations that made things much more affordable for so many more people, South Korea ultimately became prosperous. 
As the country grew prosperous, it was able to transition from an authoritarian government to a democratic government and has been able to reinvest in building its institutions. 
And this has paid off tremendously. 
For instance, in 2018, South Korea's president was sentenced to 25 years in prison on corruption-related charges. 
This could never have happened decades ago when the country was poor and ruled by an authoritarian government. 
In fact, as we looked at most prosperous countries today, what we found was, they were able to reduce corruption as they became prosperous -- not before. 
And so where does that leave us? 
I know it may sound like I'm saying we should just ignore corruption. 
That's not what I'm saying at all. 
What I'm suggesting, though, is that corruption, especially for most people in poor countries, is a work-around. 
It's a utility in a place where there are fewer better options to solve a problem. 
Investing in innovations that make products much more affordable for many people not only attacks this scarcity but it creates a sustainable source of revenue for governments to reinvest into the economies to strengthen their institutions. 
This is the critical missing piece in the economic development puzzle that will ultimately help us reduce corruption. 
You know, I lost hope in Nigeria when I was 16. 
And in some ways, the country has actually gotten worse. 
In addition to widespread poverty and endemic corruption, Nigeria now actually deals with terrorist organizations like Boko Haram. 
But somehow, I am more hopeful about Nigeria today than I have ever been before. 
When I see organizations investing in innovations that are creating jobs for people and making things affordable -- I mean organizations like Lifestores Pharmacy, making drugs and pharmaceuticals more affordable for people; or Metro Africa Xpress, tackling the scarcity of distribution and logistics for many small businesses; or Andela, creating economic opportunity for software developers -- I am optimistic about the future. 
I hope you will be, too. 
Thank you. 
(Applause) 

I get out of bed for two reasons. 
One, small-scale family farmers need more food. 
It's crazy that in 2019 farmers that feed us are hungry. 
And two, science needs to be more diverse and inclusive. 
If we're going to solve the toughest challenges on the planet, like food insecurity for the millions living in extreme poverty, it's going to take all of us. 
I want to use the latest technology with the most diverse and inclusive teams on the planet to help farmers have more food. 
I'm a computational biologist. 
I know -- what is that and how is it going to help end hunger? 
Basically, I like computers and biology and somehow, putting that together is a job. 
(Laughter) I don't have a story of wanting to be a biologist from a young age. 
The truth is, I played basketball in college. 
And part of my financial aid package was I needed a work-study job. 
So one random day, I wandered to the nearest building to my dorm room. 
And it just so happens it was the biology building. 
I went inside and looked at the job board. 
Yes, this is pre-the-internet. 
And I saw a three-by-five card advertising a job to work in the herbarium. 
I quickly took down the number, because it said "flexible hours," and I needed that to work around my basketball schedule. 
I ran to the library to figure out what an herbarium was. 
(Laughter) And it turns out an herbarium is where they store dead, dried plants. 
I was lucky to land the job. 
So my first scientific job was gluing dead plants onto paper for hours on end. 
(Laughter) It's so glamorous. 
This is how I became a computational biologist. 
During that time, genomics and computing were coming of age. 
And I went on to do my masters combining biology and computers. 
During that time, I worked at Los Alamos National Lab in the theoretical biology and biophysics group. 
And it was there I had my first encounter with the supercomputer, and my mind was blown. 
With the power of supercomputing, which is basically thousands of connected PCs on steroids, we were able to uncover the complexities of influenza and hepatitis C. 
And it was during this time that I saw the power of using computers and biology combined, for humanity. 
And I wanted this to be my career path. 
So, since 1999, I've spent the majority of my scientific career in very high-tech labs, surrounded by really expensive equipment. 
So many ask me how and why do I work for farmers in Africa. 
Well, because of my computing skills, in 2013, a team of East African scientists asked me to join the team in the plight to save cassava. 
Cassava is a plant whose leaves and roots feed 800 million people globally. 
And 500 million in East Africa. 
So that's nearly a billion people relying on this plant for their daily calories. 
If a small-scale family farmer has enough cassava, she can feed her family and she can sell it at the market for important things like school fees, medical expenses and savings. 
But cassava is under attack in Africa. 
Whiteflies and viruses are devastating cassava. 
Whiteflies are tiny insects that feed on the leaves of over 600 plants. 
They are bad news. 
There are many species; they become pesticide resistant; and they transmit hundreds of plant viruses that cause cassava brown streak disease and cassava mosaic disease. 
This completely kills the plant. 
And if there's no cassava, there's no food or income for millions of people. 
It took me one trip to Tanzania to realize that these women need some help. 
These amazing, strong, small-scale family farmers, the majority women, are doing it rough. 
They don't have enough food to feed their families, and it's a real crisis. 
What happens is they go out and plant fields of cassava when the rains come. 
Nine months later, there's nothing, because of these pests and pathogens. 
And I thought to myself, how in the world can farmers be hungry? 
So I decided to spend some time on the ground with the farmers and the scientists to see if I had any skills that could be helpful. 
The situation on the ground is shocking. 
The whiteflies have destroyed the leaves that are eaten for protein, and the viruses have destroyed the roots that are eaten for starch. 
An entire growing season will pass, and the farmer will lose an entire year of income and food, and the family will suffer a long hunger season. 
This is completely preventable. 
If the farmer knew what variety of cassava to plant in her field, that was resistant to those viruses and pathogens, they would have more food. 
We have all the technology we need, but the knowledge and the resources are not equally distributed around the globe. 
So what I mean specifically is, the older genomic technologies that have been required to uncover the complexities in these pests and pathogens -- these technologies were not made for sub-Saharan Africa. 
They cost upwards of a million dollars; they require constant power and specialized human capacity. 
These machines are few and far between on the continent, which is leaving many scientists battling on the front lines no choice but to send the samples overseas. 
And when you send the samples overseas, samples degrade, it costs a lot of money, and trying to get the data back over weak internet is nearly impossible. 
So sometimes it can take six months to get the results back to the farmer. 
And by then, it's too late. 
The crop is already gone, which results in further poverty and more hunger. 
We knew we could fix this. 
In 2017, we had heard of this handheld, portable DNA sequencer called an Oxford Nanopore MinION. 
This was being used in West Africa to fight Ebola. 
So we thought: Why can't we use this in East Africa to help farmers? 
So, what we did was we set out to do that. 
At the time, the technology was very new, and many doubted we could replicate this on the farm. 
When we set out to do this, one of our "collaborators" in the UK told us that we would never get that to work in East Africa, let alone on the farm. 
So we accepted the challenge. 
This person even went so far as to bet us two of the best bottles of champagne that we would never get that to work. 
Two words: pay up. 
(Laughter) (Applause) Pay up, because we did it. 
We took the entire high-tech molecular lab to the farmers of Tanzania, Kenya and Uganda, and we called it Tree Lab. 
So what did we do? 
Well, first of all, we gave ourselves a team name -- it's called the Cassava Virus Action Project. 
We made a website, we gathered support from the genomics and computing communities, and away we went to the farmers. 
Everything that we need for our Tree Lab is being carried by the team here. 
All of the molecular and computational requirements needed to diagnose sick plants is there. 
And it's actually all on this stage here as well. 
We figured if we could get the data closer to the problem, and closer to the farmer, the quicker we could tell her what was wrong with her plant. 
And not only tell her what was wrong -- give her the solution. 
And the solution is, burn the field and plant varieties that are resistant to the pests and pathogens she has in her field. 
So the first thing that we did was we had to do a DNA extraction. 
And we used this machine here. 
It's called a PDQeX, which stands for "Pretty Damn Quick Extraction." 
(Laughter) I know. 
My friend Joe is really cool. 
One of the biggest challenges in doing a DNA extraction is it usually requires very expensive equipment, and takes hours. 
But with this machine, we've been able to do it in 20 minutes, at a fraction of the cost. 
And this runs off of a motorcycle battery. 
From there, we take the DNA extraction and prepare it into a library, getting it ready to load on to this portable, handheld genomic sequencer, which is here, and then we plug this into a mini supercomputer, which is called a MinIT. 
And both of these things are plugged into a portable battery pack. 
So we were able to eliminate the requirements of main power and internet, which are two very limiting factors on a small-scale family farm. 
Analyzing the data quickly can also be a problem. 
But this is where me being a computational biologist came in handy. 
All that gluing of dead plants, and all that measuring, and all that computing finally came in handy in a real-world, real-time way. 
I was able to make customized databases and we were able to give the farmers results in three hours versus six months. 
(Applause) The farmers were overjoyed. 
So how do we know that we're having impact? 
Nine moths after our Tree Lab, Asha went from having zero tons per hectare to 40 tons per hectare. 
She had enough to feed her family and she was selling it at the market, and she's now building a house for her family. 
Yeah, so cool. 
(Applause) So how do we scale Tree Lab? 
The thing is, farmers are scaled already in Africa. 
These women work in farmer groups, so helping Asha actually helped 3,000 people in her village, because she shared the results and also the solution. 
I remember every single farmer I've ever met. 
Their pain and their joy is engraved in my memories. 
Our science is for them. 
Tree Lab is our best attempt to help them become more food secure. 
I never dreamt that the best science I would ever do in my life would be on that blanket in East Africa, with the highest-tech genomic gadgets. 
But our team did dream that we could give farmers answers in three hours versus six months, and then we did it. 
Because that's the power of diversity and inclusion in science. 
Thank you. 
(Applause) (Cheers) 

People use the internet for various reasons. 
It turns out that one of the most popular categories of website is something that people typically consume in private. 
It involves curiosity, non-insignificant levels of self-indulgence and is centered around recording the reproductive activities of other people. 
(Laughter) Of course, I'm talking about genealogy -- (Laughter) the study of family history. 
When it comes to detailing family history, in every family, we have this person that is obsessed with genealogy. 
Let's call him Uncle Bernie. 
Uncle Bernie is exactly the last person you want to sit next to in Thanksgiving dinner, because he will bore you to death with peculiar details about some ancient relatives. 
But as you know, there is a scientific side for everything, and we found that Uncle Bernie's stories have immense potential for biomedical research. 
We let Uncle Bernie and his fellow genealogists document their family trees through a genealogy website called geni.com. 
When users upload their trees to the website, it scans their relatives, and if it finds matches to existing trees, it merges the existing and the new tree together. 
The result is that large family trees are created, beyond the individual level of each genealogist. 
Now, by repeating this process with millions of people all over the world, we can crowdsource the construction of a family tree of all humankind. 
Using this website, we were able to connect 125 million people into a single family tree. 
I cannot draw the tree on the screens over here because they have less pixels than the number of people in this tree. 
But here is an example of a subset of 6,000 individuals. 
Each green node is a person. 
The red nodes represent marriages, and the connections represent parenthood. 
In the middle of this tree, you see the ancestors. 
And as we go to the periphery, you see the descendants. 
This tree has seven generations, approximately. 
Now, this is what happens when we increase the number of individuals to 70,000 people -- still a tiny subset of all the data that we have. 
Despite that, you can already see the formation of gigantic family trees with many very distant relatives. 
Thanks to the hard work of our genealogists, we can go back in time hundreds of years ago. 
For example, here is Alexander Hamilton, who was born in 1755. 
Alexander was the first US Secretary of the Treasury, but mostly known today due to a popular Broadway musical. 
We found that Alexander has deeper connections in the showbiz industry. 
In fact, he's a blood relative of ... 
Kevin Bacon! 
(Laughter) Both of them are descendants of a lady from Scotland who lived in the 13th century. 
So you can say that Alexander Hamilton is 35 degrees of Kevin Bacon genealogy. 
(Laughter) And our tree has millions of stories like that. 
We invested significant efforts to validate the quality of our data. 
Using DNA, we found that .3 percent of the mother-child connections in our data are wrong, which could match the adoption rate in the US pre-Second World War. 
For the father's side, the news is not as good: 1.9 percent of the father-child connections in our data are wrong. 
And I see some people smirk over here. 
It is what you think -- there are many milkmen out there. 
(Laughter) However, this 1.9 percent error rate in patrilineal connections is not unique to our data. 
Previous studies found a similar error rate using clinical-grade pedigrees. 
So the quality of our data is good, and that should not be a surprise. 
Our genealogists have a profound, vested interest in correctly documenting their family history. 
We can leverage this data to learn quantitative information about humanity, for example, questions about demography. 
Here is a look at all our profiles on the map of the world. 
Each pixel is a person that lived at some point. 
And since we have so much data, you can see the contours of many countries, especially in the Western world. 
In this clip, we stratified the map that I've showed you based on the year of births of individuals from 1400 to 1900, and we compared it to known migration events. 
The clip is going to show you that the deepest lineages in our data go all the way back to the UK, where they had better record keeping, and then they spread along the routes of Western colonialism. 
Let's watch this. 
(Music) [Year of birth: ] [1492 - Columbus sails the ocean blue] [1620 - Mayflower lands in Massachusetts] [1652 - Dutch settle in South Africa] [1788 - Great Britain penal transportation to Australia starts] [1836 - First migrants use Oregon Trail] [all activity] I love this movie. 
Now, since these migration events are giving the context of families, we can ask questions such as: What is the typical distance between the birth locations of husbands and wives? 
This distance plays a pivotal role in demography, because the patterns in which people migrate to form families determine how genes spread in geographical areas. 
We analyzed this distance using our data, and we found that in the old days, people had it easy. 
They just married someone in the village nearby. 
But the Industrial Revolution really complicated our love life. 
And today, with affordable flights and online social media, people typically migrate more than 100 kilometers from their place of birth to find their soul mate. 
So now you might ask: OK, but who does the hard work of migrating from places to places to form families? 
Are these the males or the females? 
We used our data to address this question, and at least in the last 300 years, we found that the ladies do the hard work of migrating from places to places to form families. 
Now, these results are statistically significant, so you can take it as scientific fact that males are lazy. 
(Laughter) We can move from questions about demography and ask questions about human health. 
For example, we can ask to what extent genetic variations account for differences in life span between individuals. 
Previous studies analyzed the correlation of longevity between twins to address this question. 
They estimated that the genetic variations account for about a quarter of the differences in life span between individuals. 
But twins can be correlated due to so many reasons, including various environmental effects or a shared household. 
Large family trees give us the opportunity to analyze both close relatives, such as twins, all the way to distant relatives, even fourth cousins. 
This way we can build robust models that can tease apart the contribution of genetic variations from environmental factors. 
We conducted this analysis using our data, and we found that genetic variations explain only 15 percent of the differences in life span between individuals. 
That is five years, on average. 
So genes matter less than what we thought before to life span. 
And I find it great news, because it means that our actions can matter more. 
Smoking, for example, determines 10 years of our life expectancy -- twice as much as what genetics determines. 
We can even have more surprising findings as we move from family trees and we let our genealogists document and crowdsource DNA information. 
And the results can be amazing. 
It might be hard to imagine, but Uncle Bernie and his friends can create DNA forensic capabilities that even exceed what the FBI currently has. 
When you place the DNA on a large family tree, you effectively create a beacon that illuminates the hundreds of distant relatives that are all connected to the person that originated the DNA. 
By placing multiple beacons on a large family tree, you can now triangulate the DNA of an unknown person, the same way that the GPS system uses multiple satellites to find a location. 
The prime example of the power of this technique is capturing the Golden State Killer, one of the most notorious criminals in the history of the US. 
The FBI had been searching for this person for over 40 years. 
They had his DNA, but he never showed up in any police database. 
About a year ago, the FBI consulted a genetic genealogist, and she suggested that they submit his DNA to a genealogy service that can locate distant relatives. 
They did that, and they found a third cousin of the Golden State Killer. 
They built a large family tree, scanned the different branches of that tree, until they found a profile that exactly matched what they knew about the Golden State Killer. 
They obtained DNA from this person and found a perfect match to the DNA they had in hand. 
They arrested him and brought him to justice after all these years. 
Since then, genetic genealogists have started working with local US law enforcement agencies to use this technique in order to capture criminals. 
And only in the past six months, they were able to solve over 20 cold cases with this technique. 
Luckily, we have people like Uncle Bernie and his fellow genealogists These are not amateurs with a self-serving hobby. 
These are citizen scientists with a deep passion to tell us who we are. 
And they know that the past can hold a key to the future. 
Thank you very much. 
(Applause) 

No matter who you are or where you live, I'm guessing that you have at least one relative that likes to forward those emails. 
You know the ones I'm talking about -- the ones with dubious claims or conspiracy videos. 
And you've probably already muted them on Facebook for sharing social posts like this one. 
It's an image of a banana with a strange red cross running through the center. 
And the text around it is warning people not to eat fruits that look like this, suggesting they've been injected with blood contaminated with the HIV virus. 
And the social share message above it simply says, "Please forward to save lives." 
Now, fact-checkers have been debunking this one for years, but it's one of those rumors that just won't die. 
A zombie rumor. 
And, of course, it's entirely false. 
It might be tempting to laugh at an example like this, to say, "Well, who would believe this, anyway?" 
But the reason it's a zombie rumor is because it taps into people's deepest fears about their own safety and that of the people they love. 
And if you spend as enough time as I have looking at misinformation, you know that this is just one example of many that taps into people's deepest fears and vulnerabilities. 
Every day, across the world, we see scores of new memes on Instagram encouraging parents not to vaccinate their children. 
We see new videos on YouTube explaining that climate change is a hoax. 
And across all platforms, we see endless posts designed to demonize others on the basis of their race, religion or sexuality. 
Welcome to one of the central challenges of our time. 
How can we maintain an internet with freedom of expression at the core, while also ensuring that the content that's being disseminated doesn't cause irreparable harms to our democracies, our communities and to our physical and mental well-being? 
Because we live in the information age, yet the central currency upon which we all depend -- information -- is no longer deemed entirely trustworthy and, at times, can appear downright dangerous. 
This is thanks in part to the runaway growth of social sharing platforms that allow us to scroll through, where lies and facts sit side by side, but with none of the traditional signals of trustworthiness. 
And goodness -- our language around this is horribly muddled. 
People are still obsessed with the phrase "fake news," despite the fact that it's extraordinarily unhelpful and used to describe a number of things that are actually very different: lies, rumors, hoaxes, conspiracies, propaganda. 
And I really wish we could stop using a phrase that's been co-opted by politicians right around the world, from the left and the right, used as a weapon to attack a free and independent press. 
(Applause) Because we need our professional news media now more than ever. 
And besides, most of this content doesn't even masquerade as news. 
It's memes, videos, social posts. 
And most of it is not fake; it's misleading. 
We tend to fixate on what's true or false. 
But the biggest concern is actually the weaponization of context. 
Because the most effective disinformation has always been that which has a kernel of truth to it. 
Let's take this example from London, from March 2017, a tweet that circulated widely in the aftermath of a terrorist incident on Westminster Bridge. 
This is a genuine image, not fake. 
The woman who appears in the photograph was interviewed afterwards, and she explained that she was utterly traumatized. 
She was on the phone to a loved one, and she wasn't looking at the victim out of respect. 
But it still was circulated widely with this Islamophobic framing, with multiple hashtags, including: #BanIslam. 
Now, if you worked at Twitter, what would you do? 
Would you take that down, or would you leave it up? 
My gut reaction, my emotional reaction, is to take this down. 
I hate the framing of this image. 
But freedom of expression is a human right, and if we start taking down speech that makes us feel uncomfortable, we're in trouble. 
And this might look like a clear-cut case, but, actually, most speech isn't. 
These lines are incredibly difficult to draw. 
What's a well-meaning decision by one person is outright censorship to the next. 
What we now know is that this account, Texas Lone Star, was part of a wider Russian disinformation campaign, one that has since been taken down. 
Would that change your view? 
It would mine, because now it's a case of a coordinated campaign to sow discord. 
And for those of you who'd like to think that artificial intelligence will solve all of our problems, I think we can agree that we're a long way away from AI that's able to make sense of posts like this. 
So I'd like to explain three interlocking issues that make this so complex and then think about some ways we can consider these challenges. 
First, we just don't have a rational relationship to information, we have an emotional one. 
It's just not true that more facts will make everything OK, because the algorithms that determine what content we see, well, they're designed to reward our emotional responses. 
And when we're fearful, oversimplified narratives, conspiratorial explanations and language that demonizes others is far more effective. 
And besides, many of these companies, their business model is attached to attention, which means these algorithms will always be skewed towards emotion. 
Second, most of the speech I'm talking about here is legal. 
It would be a different matter if I was talking about child sexual abuse imagery or content that incites violence. 
It can be perfectly legal to post an outright lie. 
But people keep talking about taking down "problematic" or "harmful" content, but with no clear definition of what they mean by that, including Mark Zuckerberg, who recently called for global regulation to moderate speech. 
And my concern is that we're seeing governments right around the world rolling out hasty policy decisions that might actually trigger much more serious consequences when it comes to our speech. 
And even if we could decide which speech to take up or take down, we've never had so much speech. 
Every second, millions of pieces of content are uploaded by people right around the world in different languages, drawing on thousands of different cultural contexts. 
We've simply never had effective mechanisms to moderate speech at this scale, whether powered by humans or by technology. 
And third, these companies -- Google, Twitter, Facebook, WhatsApp -- they're part of a wider information ecosystem. 
We like to lay all the blame at their feet, but the truth is, the mass media and elected officials can also play an equal role in amplifying rumors and conspiracies when they want to. 
As can we, when we mindlessly forward divisive or misleading content without trying. 
We're adding to the pollution. 
I know we're all looking for an easy fix. 
But there just isn't one. 
Any solution will have to be rolled out at a massive scale, internet scale, and yes, the platforms, they're used to operating at that level. 
But can and should we allow them to fix these problems? 
They're certainly trying. 
But most of us would agree that, actually, we don't want global corporations to be the guardians of truth and fairness online. 
And I also think the platforms would agree with that. 
And at the moment, they're marking their own homework. 
They like to tell us that the interventions they're rolling out are working, but because they write their own transparency reports, there's no way for us to independently verify what's actually happening. 
(Applause) And let's also be clear that most of the changes we see only happen after journalists undertake an investigation and find evidence of bias or content that breaks their community guidelines. 
So yes, these companies have to play a really important role in this process, but they can't control it. 
So what about governments? 
Many people believe that global regulation is our last hope in terms of cleaning up our information ecosystem. 
But what I see are lawmakers who are struggling to keep up to date with the rapid changes in technology. 
And worse, they're working in the dark, because they don't have access to data to understand what's happening on these platforms. 
And anyway, which governments would we trust to do this? 
We need a global response, not a national one. 
So the missing link is us. 
It's those people who use these technologies every day. 
Can we design a new infrastructure to support quality information? 
Well, I believe we can, and I've got a few ideas about what we might be able to actually do. 
So firstly, if we're serious about bringing the public into this, can we take some inspiration from Wikipedia? 
They've shown us what's possible. 
Yes, it's not perfect, but they've demonstrated that with the right structures, with a global outlook and lots and lots of transparency, you can build something that will earn the trust of most people. 
Because we have to find a way to tap into the collective wisdom and experience of all users. 
This is particularly the case for women, people of color and underrepresented groups. 
Because guess what? 
They are experts when it comes to hate and disinformation, because they have been the targets of these campaigns for so long. 
And over the years, they've been raising flags, and they haven't been listened to. 
This has got to change. 
So could we build a Wikipedia for trust? 
Could we find a way that users can actually provide insights? 
They could offer insights around difficult content-moderation decisions. 
They could provide feedback when platforms decide they want to roll out new changes. 
Second, people's experiences with the information is personalized. 
My Facebook news feed is very different to yours. 
Your YouTube recommendations are very different to mine. 
That makes it impossible for us to actually examine what information people are seeing. 
So could we imagine developing some kind of centralized open repository for anonymized data, with privacy and ethical concerns built in? 
Because imagine what we would learn if we built out a global network of concerned citizens who wanted to donate their social data to science. 
Because we actually know very little about the long-term consequences of hate and disinformation on people's attitudes and behaviors. 
And what we do know, most of that has been carried out in the US, despite the fact that this is a global problem. 
We need to work on that, too. 
And third, can we find a way to connect the dots? 
No one sector, let alone nonprofit, start-up or government, is going to solve this. 
But there are very smart people right around the world working on these challenges, from newsrooms, civil society, academia, activist groups. 
And you can see some of them here. 
Some are building out indicators of content credibility. 
Others are fact-checking, so that false claims, videos and images can be down-ranked by the platforms. 
A nonprofit I helped to found, First Draft, is working with normally competitive newsrooms around the world to help them build out investigative, collaborative programs. 
And Danny Hillis, a software architect, is designing a new system called The Underlay, which will be a record of all public statements of fact connected to their sources, so that people and algorithms can better judge what is credible. 
And educators around the world are testing different techniques for finding ways to make people critical of the content they consume. 
All of these efforts are wonderful, but they're working in silos, and many of them are woefully underfunded. 
There are also hundreds of very smart people working inside these companies, but again, these efforts can feel disjointed, because they're actually developing different solutions to the same problems. 
How can we find a way to bring people together in one physical location for days or weeks at a time, so they can actually tackle these problems together but from their different perspectives? 
So can we do this? 
Can we build out a coordinated, ambitious response, one that matches the scale and the complexity of the problem? 
I really think we can. 
Together, let's rebuild our information commons. 
Thank you. 
(Applause) 

(Imitates fishing cat) That's my impersonation of a fishing cat, which actually sounds more like this. 
(Prerecorded fishing cat sounds) It's a cat that loves water, loves to fish, and lives in some of the most unique and valuable ecosystems on earth: the wetlands and mangrove forests of South and Southeast Asia. 
Aren't they fishing awesome? 
(Laughter) Fishing cats are one of about 40 species of wildcats. 
Like tigers and lions, only much smaller. 
They're probably around twice the size of our average domestic cat. 
In Indonesia, people call them "kucing bakau," which literally translates to "the cat of the mangroves." 
But I like to call them the tigers of the mangroves. 
Now, we don't know fishing cats as well as we do tigers, but what we've learned is that these cats can be a flagship species to a globally important ecosystem, and a visual bait attached to a strong line for conservation. 
Are you hooked yet? 
(Laughter) Like many endangered species, fishing cats are threatened by habitat loss, mainly because of our international demand for farmed fish and shrimp, and the deforestation of nearly half the historic mangrove cover in South and Southeast Asia. 
Mangroves, on the other hand, are much more than just habitat to the fishing cat. 
They are home to a fantastic array of species, like jackals, turtles, shorebirds and otters. 
(Laughter) Mangroves also prevent soil erosion, and they can be the first line of defense between storm surges, tsunamis and the millions of people who live next to these forests for their day-to-day survival. 
The fact that puts the icing on the cake -- or the earth, I should say -- is that mangroves can store upwards of five to ten times more carbon dioxide than tropical forests. 
So protecting one acre of mangroves may well be like protecting five or more acres of tropical forests. 
Would you like to eliminate you entire life's carbon footprint? 
Well, mangroves can offer you one of the best bangs for your conservation buck. 
Deforestation, extinction and climate change are all global problems that we can solve by giving value to our species and ecosystems and by working together with the local people who live next to them. 
This is one of three river deltas in coastal South India where communities came together to change the face and potentially, the fate of this planet. 
In less than a decade, with international support, the state forest departments and the local communities worked together to restore over 20,000 acres of unproductive fish and shrimp farms back into mangroves. 
About five years ago, guess who we discovered in these restored mangroves? 
When we shared images of these fishing cats with local people, we were able to build pride among them about a globally revered endangered species and ecosystem in their backyards. 
We were also able to build trust with some people to help them lead alternative livelihoods. 
Meet Santosh, a 19-year-old boy who not only became a conservation professional after working with us for just over a year but also went on to involve many local fishermen in helping study and protect fishing cats. 
Meet Moshi, a tribal poacher, who not only stopped hunting and became our most prized conservationist, but also used his traditional knowledge to educate his entire community to stop hunting fishing cats, otters and the many other threatened species that live in the mangroves in his backyard. 
Fish and shrimp farmers, like Venkat, are now willing to work with us conservationists to test the sustainable harvest of ecosystem services like crabs, and possibly even honey, from mangroves. 
Incentives that could get them to protect and plant mangroves where they have been lost. 
A win-win-win for fishing cats, local people and the global community. 
These stories show us that we can all be part of a future where fishing cats and the lost mangrove forests are protected and restored by fishermen themselves, creating carbon sinks that can help offset our ecological footprints. 
So while the fishing cat may be small, I hope that we've been able to help make it a big deal. 
One that we can all invest in to help sustain our lives on earth a little longer. 
Or as our friend here would say ... 
(Prerecorded fishing cat sounds) Thank you. 
(Applause) 

I want to start with a question. 
Where does an artwork begin? 
Now sometimes that question is absurd. 
It can seem deceptively simple, as it was when I asked the question with this piece, "Portable Planetarium," that I made in 2010. 
I asked the question: "What would it look like to build a planetarium of one's own?" 
I know you all ask that every morning, but I asked myself that question. 
And as an artist, I was thinking about our effort, our desire, our continual longing that we've had over the years to make meaning of the world around us through materials. 
And for me, to try and find the kind of wonder, but also a kind of futility that lies in that very fragile pursuit, is part of my art work. 
So I bring together the materials I find around me, I gather them to try and create experiences, immersive experiences that occupy rooms, that occupy walls, landscapes, buildings. 
But ultimately, I want them to occupy memory. 
And after I've made a work, I find that there's usually one memory of that work that burns in my head. 
And this is the memory for me -- it was this sudden kind of surprising experience of being immersed inside that work of art. 
And it stayed with me and kind of reoccurred in my work about 10 years later. 
But I want to go back to my graduate school studio. 
I think it's interesting, sometimes, when you start a body of work, you need to just completely wipe the plate clean, take everything away. 
And this may not look like wiping the plate clean, but for me, it was. 
Because I had studied painting for about 10 years, and when I went to graduate school, I realized that I had developed skill, but I didn't have a subject. 
It was like an athletic skill, because I could paint the figure quickly, but I didn't know why. 
I could paint it well, but it didn't have content. 
And so I decided to put all the paints aside for a while, and to ask this question, which was: "Why and how do objects acquire value for us?" 
How does a shirt that I know thousands of people wear, a shirt like this one, how does it somehow feel like it's mine? 
So I started with that experiment, I decided, by collecting materials that had a certain quality to them. 
They were mass-produced, easily accessible, completely designed for the purpose of their use, not for their aesthetic. 
So things like toothpicks, thumbtacks, pieces of toilet paper, to see if in the way that I put my energy, my hand, my time into them, that the behavior could actually create a kind of value in the work itself. 
One of the other ideas is, I wanted the work to become live. 
So I wanted to take it off of the pedestal, not have a frame around it, have the experience not be that you came to something and told you that it was important, but that you discover that it was in your own time. 
So this is like a very, very old idea in sculpture, which is: How do we breathe life into inanimate materials? 
And so, I would go to a space like this, where there was a wall, and use the paint itself, pull the paint out off the wall, the wall paint into space to create a sculpture. 
Because I was also interested in this idea that these terms, "sculpture," "painting," "installation" -- none of these mattered in the way we actually see the world. 
So I wanted to blur those boundaries, both between mediums that artists talk about, but also blur the experience of being in life and being in art, so that when you are in your everyday, or when you are in one of my works, and you saw, you recognized the everyday, you could then move that experience into your own life, and perhaps see the art in everyday life. 
I was in graduate school in the '90s, and my studio just became more and more filled with images, as did my life. 
And this confusion of images and objects was really part of the way I was trying to make sense of materials. 
And also, I was interested in how this might change the way that we actually experience time. 
If we're experiencing time through materials, what happens when images and objects become confused in space? 
So I started by doing some of these experiments with images. 
And if you look back to the 1880s, that's when the first photographs started turning into film. 
And they were done through studies of animals, the movement of animals. 
So horses in the United States, birds in France. 
They were these studies of movement that then slowly, like zoetropes, became film. 
So I decided, I will take an animal and I'm going to play with that idea of how the image is not static for us anymore, it's moving. 
It's moving in space. 
And so I chose as my character the cheetah, because she is the fastest land-dwelling creature on earth. 
And she holds that record, and I want to use her record to actually make it kind of a measuring stick for time. 
And so this is what she looked like in the sculpture as she moved through space. 
This kind of broken framing of the image in space, because I had put up notepad paper and had it actually project on it. 
Then I did this experiment where you have kind of a race, with these new tools and video that I could play with. 
So the falcon moves out in front, the cheetah, she comes in second, and the rhino is trying to catch up behind. 
Then another one of the experiments, I was thinking about how, if we try and remember one thing that happened to us when we were, let's say, 10 years old. 
It's very hard to remember even what happened in that year. 
And for me, I can think of maybe one, maybe two, and that one moment has expanded in my mind to fill that entire year. 
So we don't experience time in minutes and seconds. 
So this is a still of the video that I took, printed out on a piece of paper, the paper is torn and then the video is projected on top of it. 
And I wanted to play with this idea of how, in this kind of complete immersion of images that's enveloped us, how one image can actually grow and can haunt us. 
So I had all of these -- these are three out of, like, 100 experiments I was trying with images for over about a decade, and never showing them, and I thought, OK, how do I bring this out of the studio, into a public space, but retain this kind of energy of experimentation that you see when you go into a laboratory, you see when you go into a studio, and I had this show coming up and I just said, alright, I'm going to put my desk right in the middle of the room. 
So I brought my desk and I put it in the room, and it actually worked in this kind of very surprising way to me, in that it was this kind of flickering, because of the video screens, from afar. 
And it had all of the projectors on it, so the projectors were creating the space around it, but you were drawn towards the flickering like a flame. 
And then you were enveloped in the piece at the scale that we're all very familiar with, which is the scale of being in front of a desk or a sink or a table, and you are immersed, then, back into this scale, this one-to-one scale of the body in relation to the image. 
But on this surface, you had these projections on paper being blown in the wind, so there was this confusion of what was an image and what was an object. 
So this is what the work looked like when it went into a larger room, and it wasn't until I made this piece that I realized that I'd effectively made the interior of a planetarium, without even realizing that. 
And I remembered, as a child, loving going to the planetarium. 
And back then, the planetarium, there was always not only these amazing images on the ceiling, but you could see the projector itself whizzing and burring, and this amazing camera in the middle of the room. 
And it was that, along with seeing the audience around you looking up, because there was an audience in the round at that time, and seeing them, and experiencing, being part of an audience. 
So this is an image from the web that I downloaded of people who took images of themselves in the work. 
And I like this image because you see how the figures get mixed with the work. 
So you have the shadow of a visitor against the projection, and you also see the projections across a person's shirt. 
So there were these self-portraits made in the work itself, and then posted, and it felt like a kind of cyclical image-making process. 
And a kind of an end to that. 
But it reminded me and brought me back to the planetarium, and that interior, and I started to go back to painting. 
And thinking about how a painting is actually, for me, about the interior images that we all have. 
There's so many interior images, and we've become so focused on what's outside our eyes. 
And how do we store memory in our mind, how certain images emerge out of nowhere or can fall apart over time. 
And I started to call this series the "Afterimage" series, which was a reference to this idea that if we all close our eyes right now, you can see there's this flickering light that lingers, and when we open it again, it lingers again -- this is happening all the time. 
And an afterimage is something that a photograph can never replace, you never feel that in a photograph. 
So it really reminds you of the limits of the camera's lens. 
So it was this idea of taking the images that were outside of me -- this is my studio -- and then trying to figure out how they were being represented inside me. 
So really quickly, I'm just going to whiz through how a process might develop for the next piece. 
So it might start with a sketch, or an image that's burned in my memory from the 18th century -- it's Piranesi's "Colosseum." 
Or a model the size of a basketball -- I built this around a basketball, the scale's evidenced by the red cup behind it. 
And that model can be put into a larger piece as a seed, and that seed can grow into a bigger piece. 
And that piece can fill a very, very large space. 
But it can funnel down into a video that's just made from my iPhone, of a puddle outside my studio in a rainy night. 
So this is an afterimage of the painting made in my memory, and even that painting can fade as memory does. 
So this is the scale of a very small image from my sketchbook. 
You can see how it can explode to a subway station that spans three blocks. 
And you could see how going into the subway station is like a journey through the pages of a sketchbook, and you can see sort of a diary of work writ across a public space, and you're turning the pages of 20 years of art work as you move through the subway. 
But even that sketch actually has a different origin, it has an origin in a sculpture that climbs a six-story building, and is scaled to a cat from the year 2002. 
I remember that because I had two black cats at the time. 
And this is an image of a work from Japan that you can see the afterimage of in the subway. 
Or a work in Venice, where you see the image etched in the wall. 
Or how a sculpture that I did at SFMOMA in 2001, and created this kind of dynamic line, how I stole that to create a dynamic line as you descend down into the subway itself. 
And this merging of mediums is really interesting to me. 
So how can you take a line that pulls tension like a sculpture and put it into a print? 
Or then use line like a drawing in a sculpture to create a dramatic perspective? 
Or how can a painting mimic the process of printmaking? 
How can an installation use the camera's lens to frame a landscape? 
How can a painting on string become a moment in Denmark, in the middle of a trek? 
And how, on the High Line, can you create a piece that camouflages itself into the nature itself and becomes a habitat for the nature around it? 
And I'll just end with two pieces that I'm making now. 
This is a piece called "Fallen Sky" that's going to be a permanent commission in Hudson Valley, and it's kind of the planetarium finally come down and grounding itself in the earth. 
And this is a work from 2013 that's going to be reinstalled, have a new life in the reopening of MOMA. 
And it's a piece that the tool itself is the sculpture. 
So the pendulum, as it swings, is used as a tool to create the piece. 
So each of the piles of objects go right up to one centimeter to the tip of that pendulum. 
So you have this combination of the lull of that beautiful swing, but also the tension that it constantly could destroy the piece itself. 
And so, it doesn't really matter where any of these pieces end up, because the real point for me is that they end up in your memory over time, and they generate ideas beyond themselves. 
Thank you. 
(Applause) 

I am a labor organizer, and in 2013, I cofounded an organization called coworker.org that uses technology to help people join with coworkers and organize for improvements in the workplace. 
Now, there are two kinds of reactions to what I do. 
Actually, no, there are three. 
The first is complete confusion about what organizing is. 
When my doctor asked what I do and I told him, he thought I meant organizing, like, Marie Kondo-style. 
(Laughter) He was like, "Oh, that's so great, I could use some of that around here. 
I would love to clean up our patient files." 
And I had to explain to him that no, no, it's not that kind of organizing, it's more like if you showed up to work tomorrow and all the nurses in the office had gotten together to ask for an across-the-board raise. 
(Laughter) "Oh," he replied, and he got really quiet. 
(Laughter) Yeah, and that's the second kind of reaction: the uncomfortable kind. 
People usually withdraw from the conversation and find someone else to talk to. 
Finally, there's the third reaction, the excited one, the, "Oh my God, yes! We need this!" 
And someone always proceeds to tell me a story. 
It's always a story about a job or a coworker or a friend who's enduring something awful at work. 
What I've noticed is that there is never a neutral response to what I do. 
You're either repelled by it, or you're struck with a lightning bolt of excitement. 
So why does my work stir up such strong reactions? 
My hunch is that it's about conflict. 
If you have power in your workplace, maybe as a CEO or a senior leader of some kind, you're going to feel uncomfortable with that power being challenged. 
But if you lack power, or you know someone who lacks it and needs it, you might grab me by the shoulders and shake me, you're so pumped. 
But really, we can all benefit from understanding what conflict can offer in our workplaces. 
The power imbalance in our workplace is real, and it's constantly changing. 
Power moves between us, depending on our roles and status. 
Now, sometimes this can feel like office politics, right? 
Which is never fun. 
But when we contest for power thoughtfully and together with our coworkers, it can be incredibly productive. 
And it's that kind of productive conflict that I want to talk to you all about today, the kind that can make some of us uncomfortable. 
Business leaders should embrace when their workers conflict with policies and decisions, both for what it teaches us and for what it says about our commitment to each other. 
So what do I mean by "productive conflict"? 
Well, let me tell you a story. 
In 2016, a store employee for an outdoor retailer -- I'll call her "Alex" -- Alex approached her boss and asked for a raise. 
Now, she was told her pay was fairly standard for her position and that her boss didn't even have the authority to give such a raise. 
And that was supposed to be the end of the conversation. 
Unhappy with that answer, Alex went home, and she decided to create a campaign on coworker.org, asking the corporate office to give raises to store employees. 
Within days, employees from around the country began joining Alex's effort and sharing their own stories about what they were earning -- 11, 12 dollars an hour -- and how that wage was impacting their lives. 
Some even shared that they had quit recently to work for competitors who paid more. 
But here's the thing: they also shared that they didn't want to quit, they liked their job, they believed in the company's mission, but for them, the pay issue was a growing problem in their work lives. 
Well, after weeks of this groundswell of employee activism, the company decided to raise wages by five to 15 percent in cities across the country. 
And that's what I mean by productive conflict: pushing up against the things that aren't working for us when there exists no other path forward. 
The other thing I learned in doing this work is that people engage in productive conflict when they care about their jobs and their coworkers. 
Now, that surprised me at first. 
I expected the worst jobs, the worst workplaces, to have the most employee activism on our site, but the opposite is often true. 
When we come together, we can accomplish great things. 
At one company, there are more than 50 campaigns by employees there on issues ranging from dress code changes to legitimate safety concerns. 
And get this: that same company has the lowest voluntary turnover rate of any major chain in its sector. 
And it also has one of the higher productivity rates as well. 
Business leaders: you shouldn't fear conflict, and you shouldn't try to tamp down on it the minute it bubbles up in your workforce. 
While it can introduce uncertainties that can be difficult to manage, those uncertainties are trying to tell you something about an underlying problem that needs your attention. 
And I think this is especially important right now, you know, as technology transforms nearly everyone's job and as the structures that contain our work are changing at a pace not seen since the Industrial Revolution. 
We all need to be shaping and participating in the future of work. 
We all need to be challenging and changing the parts of our work lives that are broken. 
So I hope the next time a coworker invites you maybe to join a sign-on letter to your boss, or a group of employees asks for a meeting to discuss their concerns about the new health care plan, I hope you'll consider it an opportunity to build a better workplace, a stronger business and an economy that works for all of us. 
Thank you. 
(Applause) 

I want to tell you a love story. 
But it doesn't have a happy ending. 
Once upon a time, I was a stubborn five-year-old who decided to become a marine biologist. 
Thirty-four years, 400 scuba dives and one PhD later, I'm still completely enamored with the ocean. 
I spent a decade working with fishing communities in the Caribbean, counting fish, interviewing fishermen, redesigning fishing gear and developing policy. 
I've been helping to figure out what sustainable management can look like for places where food security, jobs and cultures all depend on the sea. 
In the midst of all this, I fell in love. 
With a fish. 
There are over 500 fish species that live on Caribbean reefs, but the ones I just can't get out of my head are parrotfish. 
Parrotfish live on coral reefs all over the world, there are 100 species, they can grow well over a meter long and weigh over 20 kilograms, but that's the boring stuff. 
I want to tell you five incredible things about these fish. 
First, they have a mouth like a parrot's beak, which is strong enough to bite coral, although mostly they're after algae. 
They are the lawn mowers of the reef. 
This is key, because many reefs are overgrown with algae due to nutrient pollution from sewage and fertilizer that runs off of land. 
And there just aren't enough herbivores like parrotfish left out on the reefs to mow it all down. 
OK, second amazing thing. 
After all that eating, they poop fine white sand. 
A single parrotfish can produce over 380 kilograms of this pulverized coral each year. 
Sometimes, when scuba diving, I would look up from my clipboard and just see contrails of parrotfish poop raining down. 
So next time you're lounging on a tropical white-sand beach, maybe thank of parrotfish. 
(Laughter) Third, they have so much style. 
Mottled and striped, teal, magenta, yellow, orange, polka-dotted, parrotfish are a big part of what makes coral reefs so colorful. 
Plus, in true diva style, they have multiple wardrobe changes throughout their life. 
A juvenile outfit, an intermediate getup, and a terminal look. 
Fourth, with this last wardrobe change comes a sex change from female to male, termed sequential hermaphroditism. 
These large males then gather harems of females to spawn. 
Heterosexual monogamy is certainly not nature's status quo. 
And parrotfish exemplify some of the beauty of diverse reproductive strategies. 
Fifth, and the most incredible, sometimes when parrotfish cozy up into a nook in the reef at night, they secrete a mucus bubble from a gland in their head that envelops their entire body. 
This masks their scent from predators and protects them from parasites, so they can sleep soundly. 
I mean, how cool is this? 
(Laughter) So this is a confession of my love for parrotfish in all their flamboyant, algae-eating, sand-pooping, sex-changing glory. 
(Laughter) But with this love comes heartache. 
Now that groupers and snappers are woefully overfished, fishermen are targeting parrotfish. 
Spearfishing took out the large species, midnight blue and rainbow parrotfish are now exceedingly rare, and nets and traps are scooping up the smaller species. 
As both a marine biologist and a single person, I can tell you, there aren't that many fish in the sea. 
(Laughter) And then, there's my love for their home, the coral reef, which was once as vibrant as Caribbean cultures, as colorful as the architecture, and as bustling as carnival. 
Because of climate change, on top of overfishing and pollution, coral reefs may be gone within 30 years. 
An entire ecosystem erased. 
This is devastating, because hundreds of millions of people around the world depend on reefs for their nutrition and income. 
Let that sink in. 
A little bit of good news is that places like Belize, Barbuda and Bonaire are protecting these VIPs -- Very Important Parrotfish. 
Also, more and more places are establishing protected areas that protect the entire ecosystem. 
These are critical efforts, but it's not enough. 
As I stand here today, only 2.2 percent of the ocean is protected. 
Meanwhile, 90 percent of the large fish, and 80 percent of the coral on Caribbean reefs, is already gone. 
We're in the midst of the sixth mass extinction. 
And we, humans, are causing it. 
We also have the solutions. 
Reverse climate change and overfishing, protect half the ocean and stop pollution running from land. 
But these are massive undertakings requiring systemic changes, and we're really taking our sweet time getting around to it. 
Each of us can contribute, though. 
With our votes, our voices, our food choices, our skills and our dollars. 
We must overhaul both corporate practices and government policies. 
We must transform culture. 
Building community around solutions is the most important thing. 
I am never going to give up working to protect and restore this magnificent planet. 
Every bit of habitat we preserve, every tenth of a degree of warming we prevent, really does matter. 
Thankfully, I'm not motivated by hope, but rather a desire to be useful. 
Because I don't know how to give an honest talk about my beloved parrotfish and coral reefs that has a happy ending. 
Thank you. 
(Applause) 

Chris Anderson: So, you've been obsessed with this problem for the last few years. 
What is the problem, in your own words? 
Andrew Forrest: Plastic. 
Simple as that. 
Our inability to use it for the tremendous energetic commodity that it is, and just throw it away. 
CA: And so we see waste everywhere. 
At its extreme, it looks a bit like this. 
I mean, where was this picture taken? 
AF: That's in the Philippines, and you know, there's a lot of rivers, ladies and gentlemen, which look exactly like that. 
And that's the Philippines. 
So it's all over Southeast Asia. 
CA: So plastic is thrown into the rivers, and from there, of course, it ends up in the ocean. 
I mean, we obviously see it on the beaches, but that's not even your main concern. 
It's what's actually happening to it in the oceans. Talk about that. 
AF: OK, so look. Thank you, Chris. 
About four years ago, I thought I'd do something really barking crazy, and I committed to do a PhD in marine ecology. 
And the scary part about that was, sure, I learned a lot about marine life, but it taught me more about marine death and the extreme mass ecological fatality of fish, of marine life, marine mammals, very close biology to us, which are dying in the millions if not trillions that we can't count at the hands of plastic. 
CA: But people think of plastic as ugly but stable. Right? 
You throw something in the ocean, "Hey, it'll just sit there forever. 
Can't do any damage, right?" 
AF: See, Chris, it's an incredible substance designed for the economy. 
It is the worst substance possible for the environment. 
The worst thing about plastics, as soon as it hits the environment, is that it fragments. 
It never stops being plastic. 
It breaks down smaller and smaller and smaller, and the breaking science on this, Chris, which we've known in marine ecology for a few years now, but it's going to hit humans. 
We are aware now that nanoplastic, the very, very small particles of plastic, carrying their negative charge, can go straight through the pores of your skin. 
That's not the bad news. 
The bad news is that it goes straight through the blood-brain barrier, that protective coating which is there to protect your brain. 
Your brain's a little amorphous, wet mass full of little electrical charges. 
You put a negative particle into that, particularly a negative particle which can carry pathogens -- so you have a negative charge, it attracts positive-charge elements, like pathogens, toxins, mercury, lead. 
That's the breaking science we're going to see in the next 12 months. 
CA: So already I think you told me that there's like 600 plastic bags or so for every fish that size in the ocean, something like that. 
And they're breaking down, and there's going to be ever more of them, and we haven't even seen the start of the consequences of that. 
AF: No, we really haven't. 
The Ellen MacArthur Foundation, they're a bunch of good scientists, we've been working with them for a while. 
I've completely verified their work. 
They say there will be one ton of plastic, Chris, for every three tons of fish by, not 2050 -- and I really get impatient with people who talk about 2050 -- by 2025. 
That's around the corner. 
That's just the here and now. 
You don't need one ton of plastic to completely wipe out marine life. 
Less than that is going to do a fine job at it. 
So we have to end it straightaway. We've got no time. 
CA: OK, so you have an idea for ending it, and you're coming at this not as a typical environmental campaigner, I would say, but as a businessman, as an entrepreneur, who has lived -- you've spent your whole life thinking about global economic systems and how they work. 
And if I understand it right, your idea depends on heroes who look something like this. 
What's her profession? 
AF: She, Chris, is a ragpicker, and there were 15, 20 million ragpickers like her, until China stopped taking everyone's waste. 
And the price of plastic, minuscule that it was, collapsed. 
That led to people like her, which, now -- she is a child who is a schoolchild. 
She should be at school. 
That's probably very akin to slavery. 
My daughter Grace and I have met hundreds of people like her. 
CA: And there are many adults as well, literally millions around the world, and in some industries, they actually account for the fact that, for example, we don't see a lot of metal waste in the world. 
AF: That's exactly right. 
That little girl is, in fact, the hero of the environment. 
She's in competition with a great big petrochemical plant which is just down the road, the three-and-a-half-billion-dollar petrochemical plant. 
That's the problem. 
We've got more oil and gas in plastic and landfill than we have in the entire oil and gas resources of the United States. 
So she is the hero. 
And that's what that landfill looks like, ladies and gentlemen, and it's solid oil and gas. 
CA: So there's huge value potentially locked up in there that the world's ragpickers would, if they could, make a living from. 
But why can't they? 
AF: Because we have ingrained in us a price of plastic from fossil fuels, which sits just under what it takes to economically and profitably recycle plastic from plastic. 
See, all plastic is is building blocks from oil and gas. 
Plastic's 100 percent polymer, which is 100 percent oil and gas. 
And you know we've got enough plastic in the world for all our needs. 
And when we recycle plastic, if we can't recycle it cheaper than fossil fuel plastic, then, of course, the world just sticks to fossil fuel plastic. 
CA: So that's the fundamental problem, the price of recycled plastic is usually more than the price of just buying it made fresh from more oil. 
That's the fundamental problem. 
AF: A slight tweak of the rules here, Chris. 
I'm a commodity person. 
I understand that we used to have scrap metal and rubbish iron and bits of copper lying all round the villages, particularly in the developing world. 
And people worked out it's got a value. 
It's actually an article of value, not of waste. 
Now the villages and the cities and the streets are clean, you don't trip over scrap copper or scrap iron now, because it's an article of value, it gets recycled. 
CA: So what's your idea, then, to try to change that in plastics? 
AF: OK, so Chris, for most part of that PhD, I've been doing research. 
And the good thing about being a businessperson who's done OK at it is that people want to see you. 
Other businesspeople, even if you're kind of a bit of a zoo animal species they'd like to check out, they'll say, yeah, OK, we'll all meet Twiggy Forrest. 
And so once you're in there, you can interrogate them. 
And I've been to most of the oil and gas and fast-moving consumer good companies in the world, and there is a real will to change. 
I mean, there's a couple of dinosaurs who are going to hope for the best and do nothing, but there's a real will to change. 
So what I've been discussing is, the seven and a half billion people in the world don't actually deserve to have their environment smashed by plastic, their oceans rendered depauperate or barren of sea life because of plastic. 
So you come down that chain, and there's tens of thousands of brands which we all buy heaps of products from, but then there's only a hundred major resin producers, big petrochemical plants, that spew out all the plastic which is single use. 
CA: So one hundred companies are right at the base of this food chain, as it were. 
AF: Yeah. 
CA: And so what do you need those one hundred companies to do? 
AF: OK, so we need them to simply raise the value of the building blocks of plastic from oil and gas, which I call "bad plastic," raise the value of that, so that when it spreads through the brands and onto us, the customers, we won't barely even notice an increase in our coffee cup or Coke or Pepsi, or anything. 
CA: Like, what, like a cent extra? 
AF: Less. Quarter of a cent, half a cent. 
It'll be absolutely minimal. 
But what it does, it makes every bit of plastic all over the world an article of value. 
Where you have the waste worst, say Southeast Asia, India, that's where the wealth is most. 
CA: OK, so it feels like there's two parts to this. 
One is, if they will charge more money but carve out that excess and pay it -- into what? -- a fund operated by someone to tackle this problem of -- what? 
What would that money be used for, that they charge the extra for? 
AF: So when I speak to really big businesses, I say, "Look, I need you to change, and I need you to change really fast," their eyes are going to peel over in boredom, unless I say, "And it's good business." 
"OK, now you've got my attention, Andrew." 
So I say, "Right, I need you to make a contribution to an environmental and industry transition fund. 
Over two or three years, the entire global plastics industry can transition from getting its building blocks from fossil fuel to getting its building blocks from plastic. 
The technology is out there. 
It's proven." 
I've taken two multibillion-dollar operations from nothing, recognizing that the technology can be scaled. 
I see at least a dozen technologies in plastic to handle all types of plastic. 
So once those technologies have an economic margin, which this gives them, that's where the global public will get all their plastic from, from existing plastic. 
CA: So every sale of virgin plastic contributes money to a fund that is used to basically transition the industry and start to pay for things like cleanup and other pieces. 
AF: Absolutely. Absolutely. 
CA: And it has the incredible side benefit, which is maybe even the main benefit, of creating a market. 
It suddenly makes recyclable plastic a giant business that can unlock millions of people around the world to find a new living collecting it. 
AF: Yeah, exactly. 
So all you do is, you've got fossil fuel plastics at this value and recycled plastic at this value. 
You change it. 
So recycled plastic is cheaper. 
What I love about this most, Chris, is that, you know, we waste into the environment 300, 350 million tons of plastic. 
On the oil and gas companies own accounts, it's going to grow to 500 million tons. 
This is an accelerating problem. 
But every ton of that is polymer. 
Polymer is 1,000 dollars, 1,500 dollars a ton. 
That's half a trillion dollars which could go into business and could create jobs and opportunities and wealth right across the world, particularly in the most impoverished. 
Yet we throw it away. 
CA: So this would allow the big companies to invest in recycling plants literally all over the world -- AF: All over the world. 
Because the technology is low-capital cost, you can put it in at rubbish dumps, at the bottom of big hotels, garbage depots, everywhere, turn that waste into resin. 
CA: Now, you're a philanthropist, and you're ready to commit some of your own wealth to this. 
What is the role of philanthropy in this project? 
AF: I think what we have to do is kick in the 40 to 50 million US dollars to get it going, and then we have to create absolute transparency so everyone can see exactly what's going on. 
From the resin producers to the brands to the consumers, everyone gets to see who is playing the game, who is protecting the Earth, and who doesn't care. 
And that'll cost about a million dollars a week, and we're going to underwrite that for five years. 
Total contribution is circa 300 million US dollars. 
CA: Wow. 
Now -- (Applause) You've talked to other companies, like to the Coca-Colas of this world, who are willing to do this, they're willing to pay a higher price, they would like to pay a higher price, so long as it's fair. 
AF: Yeah, it's fair. 
So, Coca-Cola wouldn't like Pepsi to play ball unless the whole world knew that Pepsi wasn't playing ball. 
Then they don't care. 
So it's that transparency of the market where, if people try and cheat the system, the market can see it, the consumers can see it. 
The consumers want a role to play in this. 
Seven and a half billion of us. 
We don't want our world smashed by a hundred companies. 
CA: Well, so tell us, you've said what the companies can do and what you're willing to do. 
What can people listening do? 
AF: OK, so I would like all of us, all around the world, to go a website called noplasticwaste.org. 
You contact your hundred resin producers which are in your region. 
You will have at least one within an email or Twitter or a telephone contact from you, and let them know that you would like them to make a contribution to a fund which industry can manage or the World Bank can manage. 
It raises tens of billions of dollars per year so you can transition the industry to getting all its plastic from plastic, not from fossil fuel. 
We don't need that. That's bad. This is good. 
And it can clean up the environment. 
We've got enough capital there, we've got tens of billions of dollars, Chris, per annum to clean up the environment. 
CA: You're in the recycling business. 
Isn't this a conflict of interest for you, or rather, a huge business opportunity for you? 
AF: Yeah, look, I'm in the iron ore business, and I compete against the scrap metal business, and that's why you don't have any scrap lying around to trip over, and cut your toe on, because it gets collected. 
CA: This isn't your excuse to go into the plastic recycling business. 
AF: No, I am going to cheer for this boom. 
This will be the internet of plastic waste. 
This will be a boom industry which will spread all over the world, and particularly where poverty is worst because that's where the rubbish is most, and that's the resource. 
So I'm going to cheer for it and stand back. 
CA: Twiggy, we're in an era where so many people around the world are craving a new, regenerative economy, these big supply chains, these big industries, to fundamentally transform. 
It strikes me as a giant idea, and you're going to need a lot of people cheering you on your way to make it happen. 
Thank you for sharing this with us. 
AF: Thank you very much. Thank you, Chris. 
(Applause) 

Hello. 
My name is Herman, and I've always been struck by how the most important, impactful, tsunami-like changes to our culture and our society always come from those things that we least think are going to have that impact. 
I mean, as a computer scientist, I remember when Facebook was just image-sharing in dorm rooms, and depending upon who you ask, it's now involved in toppling elections. 
I remember when cryptocurrency or automated trading were sort of ideas by a few renegades in the financial institutions in the world for automated trading, or online, for cryptocurrency, and they're now coming to quickly shape the way that we operate. 
And I think each of you can recall that moment where one of these ideas felt like some ignorable, derisive thing, and suddenly, oh, crap, the price of Bitcoin is what it is. 
Or, oh, crap, guess who's been elected. 
The reality is that, you know, from my perspective, I think that we're about to encounter that again. 
And I think one of the biggest, most impactful changes in the way we live our lives, to the ways we're educated, probably even to how we end up making an income, is about to come not from AI, not from space travel or biotech -- these are all very important future inventions -- but in the next five years, I think it's going to come from video games. 
So that's a bold claim, OK. 
I see some skeptical faces in the audience. 
But if we take a moment to try to look at what video games are already becoming in our lives today, and what just a little bit of technological advancement is about to create, it starts to become more of an inevitability. 
And I think the possibilities are quite electrifying. 
So let's just take a moment to think about scale. 
I mean, there's already 2.6 billion people who play games. 
And the reality is that's a billion more than five years ago. 
A billion more people in that time. 
No religion, no media, nothing has spread like that. 
And there's likely to be a billion more when Africa and India gain the infrastructure to sort of fully realize the possibilities of gaming. 
But what I find really special is -- and this often shocks a lot of people -- is that the average age of a gamer, like, have a guess, think about it. 
It's not six, it's not 18, it's not 12. 
It's 34. 
[Average age of an American gamer] It's older than me. 
And that tells us something, that this isn't entertainment for children anymore. 
This is already a medium like literature or anything else that's becoming a fundamental part of our lives. 
One stat I like is that people who generally picked up gaming in the last sort of 15, 20 years generally don't stop. 
Something changed in the way that this medium is organized. 
And more than that, it's not just play anymore, right? 
You've heard some examples today, but people are earning an income playing games. 
And not in the obvious ways. 
Yes, there's e-sports, there's prizes, there's the opportunity to make money in a competitive way. 
But there's also people earning incomes modding games, building content in them, doing art in them. 
I mean, there's something at a scale akin to the Florentine Renaissance, happening on your kid's iPhone in your living room. 
And it's being ignored. 
Now, what's even more exciting for me is what's about to happen. 
And when you think about gaming, you're probably already imagining that it features these massive, infinite worlds, but the truth is, games have been deeply limited for a very long time in a way that kind of we in the industry have tried very hard to cover up with as much trickery as possible. 
The metaphor I like to use, if you'd let me geek out for a moment, is the notion of a theater. 
For the last 10 years, games have massively advanced the visual effects, the physical immersion, the front end of games. 
But behind the scenes, the actual experiential reality of a game world has remained woefully limited. 
I'll put that in perspective for a moment. 
I could leave this theater right now, I could do some graffiti, get in a fight, fall in love. 
I might actually do all of those things after this, but the point is that all of that would have consequence. 
It would ripple through reality -- all of you could interact with that at the same time. 
It would be persistent. 
And those are very important qualities to what makes the real world real. 
Now, behind the scenes in games, we've had a limit for a very long time. 
And the limit is, behind the visuals, the actual information being exchanged between players or entities in a single game world has been deeply bounded by the fact that games mostly take place on a single server or a single machine. 
Even The World of Warcraft is actually thousands of smaller worlds. 
When you hear about concerts in Fortnite, you're actually hearing about thousands of small concerts. 
You know, individual, as was said earlier today, campfires or couches. 
There isn't really this possibility to bring it all together. 
Let's take a moment to just really understand what that means. 
When you look at a game, you might see this, beautiful visuals, all of these things happening in front of you. 
But behind the scenes in an online game, this is what it looks like. 
To a computer scientist, all you see is just a little bit of information being exchanged by a tiny handful of meaningful entities or objects. 
You might be thinking, "I've played in an infinite world." 
Well it's more that you've played on a treadmill. 
As you've been walking through that world, we've been cleverly causing the parts of it that you're not in to vanish, and the parts of it in front of you to appear. 
A good trick, but not the basis for the revolution that I promised you in the beginning of this talk. 
But the reality is, for those of you that are passionate gamers and might be excited about this, and for those of you that are afraid and may not be, all of that is about to change. 
Because finally, the technology is in place to go well beyond the limits that we've previously seen. 
I've dedicated my career to this, there are many others working on the problem -- I'd hardly take credit for it myself, but we're at the point now where we can finally do this impossible hard thing of weaving together thousands of disparate machines into single simulations that are convenient enough to not be one-offs, but to be buildable by anybody. 
And to be at the point where we can start to experience those things that we can't yet fathom. 
Let's just take a moment to visualize that. 
I'm talking about not individual little simulations but a massive possibility of huge networks of interaction. 
Massive global events that can happen inside that. 
Things that even in the real world become challenging to produce at that kind of scale. 
And I know some of you are gamers, so I'm going to show you some footage of some things that I'm pretty sure I'm allowed to do, from some of our partners. 
TED and me had a back-and-forth on this. 
These are a few things that not many people have seen before, some new experiences powered by this type of technology. 
I'll just [take] a moment to show you some of this stuff. 
This is a single game world with thousands of simultaneous people participating in a conflict. 
It also has its own ecosystem, its own sense of predator and prey. 
Every single object you see here is simulated in some way. 
This is a game being built by one of the biggest companies in the world, NetEase, a huge Chinese company. 
And they've made an assistant creative simulation where groups of players can cocreate together, across multiple devices, in a world that doesn't vanish when you're done. 
It's a place to tell stories and have adventures. 
Even the weather is simulated. 
And that's kind of awesome. 
And this is my personal favorite. 
This is a group of people, pioneers in Berlin, a group called Klang Games, and they're completely insane, and they'll love me for saying that. 
And they found a way to model, basically, an entire planet. 
They're going to have a simulation with millions of non-player characters and players engaging. 
They actually grabbed Lawrence Lessig to help understand the political ramifications of the world they're creating. 
This is the sort of astounding set of experiences, well beyond what we might have imagined, that are now going to be possible. 
And that's just the first step in this technology. 
So if we step beyond that, what happens? 
Well, computer science tends to be all exponential, once we crack the really hard problems. 
And I'm pretty sure that very soon, we're going to be in a place where we can make this type of computational power look like nothing. 
And when that happens, the opportunities ... 
It's worth taking a moment to try to imagine what I'm talking about here. 
Hundreds of thousands or millions of people being able to coinhabit the same space. 
The last time any of us as a species had the opportunity to build or do something together with that may people was in antiquity. 
And the circumstances were less than optimal, shall we say. 
Mostly conflicts or building pyramids. 
Not necessarily the best thing for us to be spending our time doing. 
But if you bring together that many people, the kind of shared experience that can create ... 
I think it exercises a social muscle in us that we've lost and forgotten. 
Going even beyond that, I want to take a moment to think about what it means for relationships, for identity. 
If we can give each other worlds, experiences at scale where we can spend a meaningful amount of our time, we can change what it means to be an individual. 
We can go beyond a single identity to a diverse set of personal identities. 
The gender, the race, the personality traits you were born with might be something you want to experiment differently with. 
You might be someone that wants to be more than one person. 
We all are, inside, multiple people. 
We rarely get the opportunity to flex that. 
It's also about empathy. 
I have a grandmother who I have literally nothing in common with. 
I love her to bits, but every story she has begins in 1940 and ends sometime in 1950. 
And every story I have is like 50 years later. 
But if we could coinhabit, co-experience things together, that undiminished by physical frailty or by lack of context, create opportunities together, that changes things, that bonds people in different ways. 
I'm struck by how social media has amplified our many differences, and really made us more who we are in the presence of other people. 
I think games could really start to create an opportunity for us to empathize again. 
To have shared adversity, shared opportunity. 
I mean, statistically, at this moment in time, there are people who are on the opposite sides of a conflict, who have been matchmade together into a game and don't even know it. 
That's an incredible opportunity to change the way we look at things. 
Finally, for those of you who perhaps are more cynical about all of this, who maybe don't think that virtual worlds and games are your cup of tea. 
There's a reality you have to accept, and that is that the economic impact of what I'm talking about will be profound. 
Right now, thousands of people have full-time jobs in gaming. 
Soon, it will be millions of people. 
Wherever there's a mobile phone, there will be a job. 
An opportunity for something that is creative and rich and gives you an income, no matter what country you're in, no matter what skills or opportunities you might think you have. 
Probably the first dollar most kids born today make might be in a game. 
That will be the new paper route, that will be the new opportunity for an income at the earliest time in your life. 
So I kind of want to end with almost a plea, really, more than thoughts. 
A sense of, I think, how we need to face this new opportunity a little differently to some we have in the past. 
It's so hypocritical for yet another technologist to stand up on stage and say, "The future will be great, technology will fix it." 
And the reality is, this is going to have downsides. 
But those downsides will only be amplified if we approach, once again, with cynicism and derision, the opportunities that this presents. 
The worst thing that we could possibly do is let the same four or five companies end up dominating yet another adjacent space. 
(Applause) Because they're not just going to define how and who makes money from this. 
The reality is, we're now talking about defining how we think, what the rules are around identity and collaboration, the rules of the world we live in. 
This has got to be something we all own, we all cocreate. 
So, my final plea is really to those engineers, those scientists, those artists in the audience today. 
Maybe some of you dreamed of working on space travel. 
The reality is, there are worlds you can build right here, right now, that can transform people's lives. 
There are still huge technological frontiers that need to be overcome here, akin to those we faced when building the early internet. 
All the technology behind virtual worlds is different. 
So, my plea to you is this. 
Let's engage, let's all engage, let's actually try to make this something that we shape in a positive way, rather than once again have be done to us. 
Thank you. 
(Applause) 

In 2003, when we sequenced the human genome, we thought we would have the answer to treat many diseases. 
But the reality is far from that, because in addition to our genes, our environment and lifestyle could have a significant role in developing many major diseases. 
One example is fatty liver disease, which is affecting over 20 percent of the population globally, and it has no treatment and leads to liver cancer or liver failure. 
So sequencing DNA alone doesn't give us enough information to find effective therapeutics. 
On the bright side, there are many other molecules in our body. 
In fact, there are over 100,000 metabolites. 
Metabolites are any molecule that is supersmall in their size. 
Known examples are glucose, fructose, fats, cholesterol -- things we hear all the time. 
Metabolites are involved in our metabolism. 
They are also downstream of DNA, so they carry information from both our genes as well as lifestyle. 
Understanding metabolites is essential to find treatments for many diseases. 
I've always wanted to treat patients. 
Despite that, 15 years ago, I left medical school, as I missed mathematics. 
Soon after, I found the coolest thing: I can use mathematics to study medicine. 
Since then, I've been developing algorithms to analyze biological data. 
So, it sounded easy: let's collect data from all the metabolites in our body, develop mathematical models to describe how they are changed in a disease and intervene in those changes to treat them. 
Then I realized why no one has done this before: it's extremely difficult. 
(Laughter) There are many metabolites in our body. 
Each one is different from the other one. 
For some metabolites, we can measure their molecular mass using mass spectrometry instruments. 
But because there could be, like, 10 molecules with the exact same mass, we don't know exactly what they are, and if you want to clearly identify all of them, you have to do more experiments, which could take decades and billions of dollars. 
So we developed an artificial intelligence, or AI, platform, to do that. 
We leveraged the growth of biological data and built a database of any existing information about metabolites and their interactions with other molecules. 
We combined all this data as a meganetwork. 
Then, from tissues or blood of patients, we measure masses of metabolites and find the masses that are changed in a disease. 
But, as I mentioned earlier, we don't know exactly what they are. 
A molecular mass of 180 could be either the glucose, galactose or fructose. 
They all have the exact same mass but different functions in our body. 
Our AI algorithm considered all these ambiguities. 
It then mined that meganetwork to find how those metabolic masses are connected to each other that result in disease. 
And because of the way they are connected, then we are able to infer what each metabolite mass is, like that 180 could be glucose here, and, more importantly, to discover how changes in glucose and other metabolites lead to a disease. 
This novel understanding of disease mechanisms then enable us to discover effective therapeutics to target that. 
So we formed a start-up company to bring this technology to the market and impact people's lives. 
Now my team and I at ReviveMed are working to discover therapeutics for major diseases that metabolites are key drivers for, like fatty liver disease, because it is caused by accumulation of fats, which are types of metabolites in the liver. 
As I mentioned earlier, it's a huge epidemic with no treatment. 
And fatty liver disease is just one example. 
Moving forward, we are going to tackle hundreds of other diseases with no treatment. 
And by collecting more and more data about metabolites and understanding how changes in metabolites leads to developing diseases, our algorithms will get smarter and smarter to discover the right therapeutics for the right patients. 
And we will get closer to reach our vision of saving lives with every line of code. 
Thank you. 
(Applause) 

Before I get started: I'm really excited to be here to just actually watch what's going to happen, from here. 
So with that said, we're going to start with: What is one of our greatest needs, one of our greatest needs for our brain? 
And instead of telling you, I want to show you. 
In fact, I want you to feel it. 
There's a lot I want you to feel in the next 14 minutes. 
So, if we could all stand up. 
We're all going to conduct a piece of Strauss together. 
Alright? And you all know it. 
Alright. Are you ready? 
Audience: Yeah! 
Beau Lotto: Alright. Ready, one, two, three! 
It's just the end. 
(Music: Richard Strauss "Also Sprach Zarathustra") Right? 
You know where it's going. 
(Music) Oh, it's coming! 
(Music stops abruptly) Oh! 
(Laughter) Right? 
Collective coitus interruptus. 
OK, you can all sit down. 
(Laughter) We have a fundamental need for closure. 
(Laughter) We love closure. 
(Applause) I was told the story that Mozart, just before he'd go to bed, he'd go to the piano and go, "da-da-da-da-da." 
His father, who was already in bed, would think, "Argh." 
He'd have to get up and hit the final note to the chord before he could go back to sleep. 
(Laughter) So the need for closure leads us to thinking about: What is our greatest fear? 
Think -- what is our greatest fear growing up, even now? 
And it's the fear of the dark. 
We hate uncertainty. 
We hate to not know. 
We hate it. 
Think about horror films. 
Horror films are always shot in the dark, in the forest, at night, in the depths of the sea, the blackness of space. 
And the reason is because dying was easy during evolution. 
If you weren't sure that was a predator, it was too late. 
Your brain evolved to predict. 
And if you couldn't predict, you died. 
And the way your brain predicts is by encoding the bias and assumptions that were useful in the past. 
But those assumptions just don't stay inside your brain. 
You project them out into the world. 
There is no bird there. 
You're projecting the meaning onto the screen. 
Everything I'm saying to you right now is literally meaningless. 
(Laughter) You're creating the meaning and projecting it onto me. 
And what's true for objects is true for other people. 
While you can measure their "what" and their "when," you can never measure their "why." 
So we color other people. 
We project a meaning onto them based on our biases and our experience. 
Which is why the best of design is almost always about decreasing uncertainty. 
So when we step into uncertainty, our bodies respond physiologically and mentally. 
Your immune system will start deteriorating. 
Your brain cells wither and even die. 
Your creativity and intelligence decrease. 
We often go from fear to anger, almost too often. 
Why? Because fear is a state of certainty. 
You become morally judgmental. 
You become an extreme version of yourself. 
If you're a conservative, you become more conservative. 
If you're a liberal, you become more liberal. 
Because you go to a place of familiarity. 
The problem is that the world changes. 
And we have to adapt or die. 
And if you want to shift from A to B, the first step is not B. 
The first step is to go from A to not A -- to let go of your bias and assumptions; to step into the very place that our brain evolved to avoid; to step into the place of the unknown. 
But it's so essential that we go to this place that our brain gave us a solution. 
Evolution gave us a solution. 
And it's possibly one of the most profound perceptual experiences. 
And it's the experience of awe. 
(Music) (Applause) (Music) (Applause) (Music) (Applause) (Music) (Applause) (Cheers) (Applause) Beau Lotto: Ah, how wonderful, right? 
So right now, you're probably all feeling, at some level or another, awe. 
Right? 
So what's happening inside your brain right now? 
And for thousands of years, we've been thinking and writing and experiencing awe, and we know so little about it. 
And so to try to understand what is it and what does it do, my Lab of Misfits had just the wonderful opportunity and the pleasure to work with who are some of the greatest creators of awe that we know: the writers, the creators, the directors, the accountants, the people who are Cirque Du Soleil. 
And so we went to Las Vegas, and we recorded the brain activity of people while they're watching the performance, over 10 performances of "O," which is iconic Cirque performance. 
And we also measured the behavior before the performance, as well as a different group after the performance. 
And so we had over 200 people involved. 
So what is awe? 
What is happening inside your brain right now? 
It's a brain state. OK? 
The front part of your brain, the prefrontal cortex, which is responsible for your executive function, your attentional control, is now being downregulated. 
The part of your brain called the DMN, default mode network, which is the interaction between multiple areas in your brain, which is active during, sort of, ideation, creative thinking in terms of divergent thinking and daydreaming, is now being upregulated. 
And right about now, the activity in your prefrontal cortex is changing. 
It's becoming asymmetrical in its activity, biased towards the right, which is highly correlated when people step forward into the world, as opposed to step back. 
In fact, the activity across the brains of all these people was so correlated that we're able to train an artificial neural network to predict whether or not people are experiencing awe to an accuracy of 75 percent on average, with a maximum of 83 percent. 
So what does this brain state do? 
Well, others have demonstrated, for instance, Professors Haidt and Keltner, have told us that people feel small but connected to the world. 
And their prosocial behavior increases, because they feel an increased affinity towards others. 
And we've also shown in this study that people have less need for cognitive control. 
They're more comfortable with uncertainty without having closure. 
And their appetite for risk also increases. 
They actually seek risk, and they are better able at taking it. 
And something that was really quite profound is that when we asked people, "Are you someone who has a propensity to experience awe?" 
They were more likely to give a positive response after the performance than they were [before]. 
They literally redefined themselves and their history. 
So, awe is possibly the perception that is bigger than us. 
And in the words of Joseph Campbell, "Awe is what enables us to move forward." 
Or in the words of a dear friend, probably one of our greatest photographers, still living photographers, Duane Michaels, he said to me just the other day that maybe it gives us the curiosity to overcome our cowardice. 
So who cares? Why should we care? 
Well, consider conflict, which seems to be so omnipresent in our society at the moment. 
If you and I are in conflict, it's as if we're at the opposite ends of the same line. 
And my aim is to prove that you're wrong and to shift you towards me. 
The problem is, you are doing exactly the same. 
You're trying to prove that I'm wrong and shift me towards you. 
Notice that conflict is the setup to win but not learn. 
Your brain only learns if we move. 
Life is movement. 
So, what if we could use awe, not to get rid of conflict -- conflict is essential, conflict is how your brain expands, it's how your brain learns -- but rather, to enter conflict in a different way? 
And what if awe could enable us to enter it in at least two different ways? 
One, to give us the humility and courage to not know. 
Right? To enter conflict with a question instead of an answer. 
What would happen then? 
To enter the conflict with uncertainty instead of certainty. 
And the second is, in entering conflict that way, to seek to understand, rather than convince. 
Because everyone makes sense to themselves, right? 
And to understand another person, is to understand the biases and assumptions that give rise to their behavior. 
And we've actually initiated a pilot study to look to see whether we could use art-induced awe to facilitate toleration. 
And the results are actually incredibly positive. 
We can mitigate against anger and hate through the experience of awe generated by art. 
So where can we find awe, given how important it is? 
So, what if ... 
A suggestion: that awe is not just to be found in the grandeur. 
Awe is essential. 
Often, it's scale -- the mountains, the sunscape. 
But what if we could actually rescale ourselves and find the impossible in the simple? 
And if this is true, and our data are right, then endeavors like science, adventure, art, ideas, love, a TED conference, performance, are not only inspired by awe, but could actually be our ladders into uncertainty to help us expand. 
Thank you very much. 
(Applause) Please, come up. 
(Applause) (Cheers) (Applause) 

Growing up in northern Wisconsin, I've naturally developed a connection to the Mississippi River. 
When I was little, my sister and I would have contests to see who could spell "M-i-s-s-i-s-s-i-p-p-i" the fastest. 
When I was in elementary school, I got to learn about the early explorers and their expeditions, Marquette and Joliet, and how they used the Great Lakes and the Mississippi River and its tributaries to discover the Midwest, and to map a trade route to the Gulf of Mexico. 
In graduate school, I was fortunate to have the Mississippi River outside my research laboratory window at the University of Minnesota. 
During that five-year period, I got to know the Mississippi River. 
I got to know its temperamental nature and where it would flood its banks at one moment, and then shortly thereafter, you would see its dry shorelines. 
Today, as a physical organic chemist, I'm committed to use my training to help protect rivers, like the Mississippi, from excessive salt that can come from human activity. 
Because, you know, salt is something that can contaminate freshwater rivers. 
And freshwater rivers, they have only salt levels of .05 percent. 
And at this level, it's safe to drink. 
But the majority of the water on our planet is housed in our oceans, and ocean water has a salinity level of more than three percent. 
And if you drank that, you'd be sick very quick. 
So, if we are to compare the relative volume of ocean water to that of the river water that's on our planet, and let's say we are able to put the ocean water into an Olympic-size swimming pool, then our planet's river water would fit in a one-gallon jug. 
So you can see it's a precious resource. 
But do we treat it like a precious resource? 
Or rather, do we treat it like that old rug that you put in your front doorway and wipe your feet off on it? 
Treating rivers like that old rug has severe consequences. 
Let's take a look. 
Let's see what just one teaspoon of salt can do. 
If we add one teaspoon of salt to this Olympic-size swimming pool of ocean water, the ocean water stays ocean water. 
But if we add that same one teaspoon of salt to this one-gallon jug of fresh river water, suddenly, it becomes too salty to drink. 
So the point here is, because rivers, the volume is so small compared to the oceans, it is especially vulnerable to human activity, and we need to take care to protect them. 
So recently, I surveyed the literature to look at the river health around the world. 
And I fully expected to see ailing river health in regions of water scarcity and heavy industrial development. 
And I saw that in northern China and in India. 
But I was surprised when I read a 2018 article where there's 232 river-sampling sites sampled across the United States. 
And of those sites, 37 percent had increasing salinity levels. 
What was more surprising is that the ones with the highest increases were found on the east part of the United States, and not the arid southwest. 
The authors of this paper postulate that this could be due to using salt to deice roads. 
Potentially, another source of this salt could come from salty industrial wastewaters. 
So as you see, human activities can convert our freshwater rivers into water that's more like our oceans. 
So we need to act and do something before it's too late. 
And I have a proposal. 
We can take a three-step river-defense mechanism, and if industrial-water users practice this defense mechanism, we can put our rivers in a much safer position. 
This involves, number one, extracting less water from our rivers by implementing water recycle and reuse operations. 
Number two, we need to take the salt out of these salty industrial wastewaters and recover it and reuse it for other purposes. 
And number three, we need to convert salt consumers, who currently source our salt from mines into salt consumers that source our salt from recycled salt sources. 
This three-part defense mechanism is already in play. 
This is what northern China and India are implementing to help to rehabilitate the rivers. 
But the proposal here is to use this defense mechanism to protect our rivers, so we don't need to rehabilitate them. 
And the good news is, we have technology that can do this. 
It's with membranes. 
Membranes that can separate salt and water. 
Membranes have been around for a number of years, and they're based on polymeric materials that separate based on size, or they can separate based on charge. 
The membranes that are used to separate salt and water typically separate based on charge. 
And these membranes are negatively charged, and help to repel the negatively charged chloride ions that are in that dissolved salt. 
So, as I said, these membranes have been around for a number of years, and currently, they are purifying 25 million gallons of water every minute. 
Even more than that, actually. 
But they can do more. 
These membranes are based under the principle of reverse osmosis. 
Now osmosis is this natural process that happens in our bodies -- you know, how our cells work. 
And osmosis is where you have two chambers that separate two levels of salt concentration. 
One with low salt concentration and one with high salt concentration. 
And separating the two chambers is the semipermeable membrane. 
And under the natural osmosis process, what happens is the water naturally transports across that membrane from the area of low salt concentration to the area of high salt concentration, until an equilibrium is met. 
Now reverse osmosis, it's the reverse of this natural process. 
And in order to achieve this reversal, what we do is we apply a pressure to the high-concentration side and in doing so, we drive the water the opposite direction. 
And so the high-concentration side becomes more salty, more concentrated, and the low-concentration side becomes your purified water. 
So using reverse osmosis, we can take an industrial wastewater and convert up to 95 percent of it into pure water, leaving only five percent as this concentrated salty mixture. 
Now, this five percent concentrated salty mixture is not waste. 
So scientists have also developed membranes that are modified to allow some salts to pass through and not others. 
Using these membranes, which are commonly referred to as nanofiltration membranes, now this five percent concentrated salty solution can be converted into a purified salt solution. 
So, in total, using reverse osmosis and nanofiltration membranes, we can convert industrial wastewater into a resource of both water and salt. 
And in doing so, achieve pillars one and two of this river-defense mechanism. 
Now, I've introduced this to a number of industrial-water users, and the common response is, "Yeah, but who is going to use my salt?" 
So that's why pillar number three is so important. 
We need to transform folks that are using mine salt into consumers of recycled salt. 
So who are these salt consumers? 
Well, in 2018 in the United States, I learned that 43 percent of the salt consumed in the US was used for road salt deicing purposes. 
Thirty-nine percent was used by the chemical industry. 
So let's take a look at these two applications. 
So, I was shocked. 
In the 2018-2019 winter season, one million tons of salt was applied to the roads in the state of Pennsylvania. 
One million tons of salt is enough to fill two-thirds of an Empire State Building. 
That's one million tons of salt mined from the earth, applied to our roads, and then it washes off into the environment and into our rivers. 
So the proposal here is that we could at least source that salt from a salty industrial wastewater, and prevent that from going into our rivers, and rather use that to apply to our roads. 
So at least when the melt happens in the springtime and you have this high-salinity runoff, the rivers are at least in a better position to defend themselves against that. 
Now, as a chemist, the opportunity though that I'm more psyched about is the concept of introducing circular salt into the chemical industry. 
And the chlor-alkali industry is perfect. 
Chlor-alkali industry is the source of epoxies, it's the source of urethanes and solvents and a lot of useful products that we use in our everyday lives. 
And it uses sodium chloride salt as its key feed stack. 
So the idea here is, well, first of all, let's look at linear economy. 
So in a linear economy, they're sourcing that salt from a mine, it goes through this chlor-alkali process, made into a basic chemical, which then can get converted into another new product, or a more functional product. 
But during that conversion process, oftentimes salt is regenerated as the by-product, and it ends up in the industrial wastewater. 
So, the idea is that we can introduce circularity, and we can recycle the water and salt from those industrial wastewater streams, from the factories, and we can send it to the front end of the chlor-alkali process. 
Circular salt. 
So how impactful is this? 
Well, let's just take one example. 
Fifty percent of the world's production of propylene oxide is made through the chlor-alkali process. 
And that's a total of about five million tons of propylene oxide on an annual basis, made globally. 
So that's five million tons of salt mined from the earth converted through the chlor-alkali process into propylene oxide, and then during that process, five million tons of salt that ends up in wastewater streams. 
So five million tons is enough salt to fill three Empire State Buildings. 
And that's on an annual basis. 
So you can see how circular salt can provide a barrier to our rivers from this excessive salty discharge. 
So you might wonder, "Well, gosh, these membranes have been around for a number of years, so why aren't people implementing wastewater reuse? 
Well, the bottom line is, it costs money to implement wastewater reuse. 
And second, water in these regions is undervalued. 
Until it's too late. 
You know, if we don't plan for freshwater sustainability, there are some severe consequences. 
You can just ask one of the world's largest chemical manufacturers who last year took a 280-million dollar hit due to low river levels of the Rhine River in Germany. 
You can ask the residents of Cape Town, South Africa, who experienced a year-over-year drought drying up their water reserves, and then being asked not to flush their toilets. 
So you can see, we have solutions here, with membranes, where we can provide pure water, we can provide pure salt, using these membranes, both of these, to help to protect our rivers for future generations. 
Thank you. 

I'm thrilled to be talking to you by this high-tech method. 
Of all humans who have ever lived, the overwhelming majority would have found what we are doing here incomprehensible, unbelievable. 
Because, for thousands of centuries, in the dark time before the scientific revolution and the Enlightenment, people had low expectations. 
For their lives, for their descendants' lives. 
Typically, they expected nothing significantly new or better to be achieved, ever. 
This pessimism famously appears in the Bible, in one of the few biblical passages with a named author. 
He's called Qohelet, he's an enigmatic chap. 
He wrote, "What has been is what will be, and what has been done is what will be done; there is nothing new under the sun. 
Is there something of which it is said, 'Look, this is new.' No, that thing was already done in the ages that came before us." 
Qohelet was describing a world without novelty. 
By novelty I mean something new in Qohelet's sense, not merely something that's changed, but a significant change with lasting effects, where people really would say, "Look, this is new," and, preferably, "good." 
So, purely random changes aren't novelty. 
OK, Heraclitus did say a man can't step in the same river twice, because it's not the same river, he's not the same man. 
But if the river is changing randomly, it really is the same river. 
In contrast, if an idea in a mind spreads to other minds, and changes lives for generations, that is novelty. 
Human life without novelty is life without creativity, without progress. 
It's a static society, a zero-sum game. 
That was the living hell in which Qohelet lived. 
Like everyone, until a few centuries ago. 
It was hell, because for humans, suffering is intimately related to staticity. 
Because staticity isn't just frustrating. 
All sources of suffering -- famine, pandemics, incoming asteroids, and things like war and slavery, hurt people only until we have created the knowledge to prevent them. 
There's a story in Somerset Maugham's novel "Of Human Bondage" about an ancient sage who summarizes the entire history of mankind as, "He was born, he suffered and he died." 
And it goes on: "Life was insignificant and death without consequence." 
And indeed, the overwhelming majority of humans who have ever lived had lives of suffering and grueling labor, before dying young and in agony. 
And yes, in most generations nothing had any novel consequence for subsequent generations. 
Nevertheless, when ancient people tried to explain their condition, they typically did so in grandiose cosmic terms. 
Which was the right thing to do, as it turns out. 
Even though their actual explanations, their myths, were largely false. 
Some tried to explain the grimness and monotony of their world in terms of an endless cosmic war between good and evil, in which humans were the battleground. 
Which neatly explained why their own experience was full of suffering, and why progress never happened. 
But it wasn't true. 
Amazingly enough, all their conflict and suffering were just due to the way they processed ideas. 
Being satisfied with dogma, and just-so stories, rather than criticizing them and trying to guess better explanations of the world and of their own condition. 
Twentieth-century physics did create better explanations, but still in terms of a cosmic war. 
This time, the combatants were order and chaos, or entropy. 
That story does allow for hope for the future. 
But in another way, it's even bleaker than the ancient myths, because the villain, entropy, is preordained to have the final victory, when the inexorable laws of thermodynamics shut down all novelty with the so-called heat death of the universe. 
Currently, there's a story of a local battle in that war, between sustainability, which is order, and wastefulness, which is chaos -- that's the contemporary take on good and evil, often with the added twist that humans are the evil, so we shouldn't even try to win. 
And recently, there have been tales of another cosmic war, between gravity, which collapses the universe, and dark energy, which finally shreds it. 
So this time, whichever of those cosmic forces wins, we lose. 
All those pessimistic accounts of the human condition contain some truth, but as prophecies, they're all misleading, and all for the same reason. 
None of them portrays humans as what we really are. 
As Jacob Bronowski said, "Man is not a figure in the landscape -- he is the shaper of the landscape." 
In other words, humans are not playthings of cosmic forces, we are users of cosmic forces. 
I'll say more about that in a moment, but first, what sorts of thing create novelty? 
Well, the beginning of the universe surely did. 
The big bang, nearly 14 billion years ago, created space, time and energy, everything physical. 
And then, immediately, what I call the first era of novelty, with the first atom, the first star, the first black hole, the first galaxy. 
But then, at some point, novelty vanished from the universe. 
Perhaps from as early as 12 or 13 billion years ago, right up to the present day, there's never been any new kind of astronomical object. 
There's only been what I call the great monotony. 
So, Qohelet was accidentally even more right about the universe beyond the Sun than he was about under the Sun. 
So long as the great monotony lasts, what has been out there really is what will be. 
And there is nothing out there of which it can truly be said, "Look, this is new." 
Nevertheless, at some point during the great monotony, there was an event -- inconsequential at the time, and even billions of years later, it had affected nothing beyond its home planet -- yet eventually, it could cause cosmically momentous novelty. 
That event was the origin of life: creating the first genetic knowledge, coding for biological adaptations, coding for novelty. 
On Earth, it utterly transformed the surface. 
Genes in the DNA of single-celled organisms put oxygen in the air, extracted CO2, put chalk and iron ore into the ground, hardly a cubic inch of the surface to some depth has remained unaffected by those genes. 
The Earth became, if not a novel place on the cosmic scale, certainly a weird one. 
Just as an example, beyond Earth, only a few hundred different chemical substances have been detected. 
Presumably, there are some more in lifeless locations, but on Earth, evolution created billions of different chemicals. 
And then the first plants, animals, and then, in some ancestor species of ours, explanatory knowledge. 
For the first time in the universe, for all we know. 
Explanatory knowledge is the defining adaptation of our species. 
It differs from the nonexplanatory knowledge in DNA, for instance, by being universal. 
That is to say, whatever can be understood, can be understood through explanatory knowledge. 
And more, any physical process can be controlled by such knowledge, limited only by the laws of physics. 
And so, explanatory knowledge, too, has begun to transform the Earth's surface. 
And soon, the Earth will become the only known object in the universe that turns aside incoming asteroids instead of attracting them. 
Qohelet was understandably misled by the painful slowness of progress in his day. 
Novelty in human life was still too rare, too gradual, to be noticed in one generation. 
And in the biosphere, the evolution of novel species was even slower. 
But both things were happening. 
Now, why is there a great monotony in the universe at large, and what makes our planet buck that trend? 
Well, the universe at large is relatively simple. 
Stars are so simple that we can predict their behavior billions of years into the future, and retrodict how they formed billions of years ago. 
So why is the universe simple? 
Basically, it's because big, massive, powerful things strongly affect lesser things, and not vice versa. 
I call that the hierarchy rule. 
For example, when a comet hits the Sun, the Sun carries on just as before, but the comet is vaporized. 
For the same reason, big things are not much affected by small parts of themselves, i.e., by details. 
Which means that their overall behavior is simple. 
And since nothing very new can happen to things that remain simple, the hierarchy rule, by causing large-scale simplicity, has caused the great monotony. 
But, the saving grace is the hierarchy rule is not a law of nature. 
It just happens to have held so far in the universe, except here. 
In our biosphere, molecule-sized objects, genes, control vastly disproportionate resources. 
The first genes for photosynthesis, by causing their own proliferation, and then transforming the surface of the planet, have violated or reversed the hierarchy rule by the mind-blowing factor of 10 to the power 40. 
Explanatory knowledge is potentially far more powerful because of universality, and more rapidly created. 
When human knowledge has achieved a factor 10 to the 40, it will pretty much control the entire galaxy, and will be looking beyond. 
So humans, and any other explanation creators who may exist out there, are the ultimate agents of novelty for the universe. 
We are the reason and the means by which novelty and creativity, knowledge, progress, can have objective, large-scale physical effects. 
From the human perspective, the only alternative to that living hell of static societies is continual creation of new ideas, behaviors, new kinds of objects. 
This robot will soon be obsolete, because of new explanatory knowledge, progress. 
But from the cosmic perspective, explanatory knowledge is the nemesis of the hierarchy rule. 
It's the destroyer of the great monotony. 
So it's the creator of the next cosmological era, the Anthropocene. 
If one can speak of a cosmic war, it's not the one portrayed in those pessimistic stories. 
It's a war between monotony and novelty, between stasis and creativity. 
And in this war, our side is not destined to lose. 
If we choose to apply our unique capacity to create explanatory knowledge, we could win. 
Thanks. 
(Applause) 

For over 40 years, I've been a clinical social worker and a developmental psychologist. 
And it seemed almost natural for me to go into the helping professions. 
My parents had taught me to do good for others. 
And so I devoted my career to working with families in some of the toughest circumstances: poverty, mental illness, immigration, refugees. 
And for all those years, I've worked with hope and with optimism. 
In the past five years, though, my hope and my optimism have been put to the test. 
I've been so deeply disappointed in the way the United States government is treating families who are coming to our southern border, asking for asylum -- desperate parents with children, from El Salvador, Guatemala and Honduras, who only want to bring their kids to safety and security. 
They are fleeing some of the worst violence in the world. 
They've been attacked by gangs, assaulted, raped, extorted, threatened. 
They have faced death. 
And they can't turn to their police because the police are complicit, corrupt, ineffective. 
Then they get to our border, and we put them in detention centers, prisons, as if they were common criminals. 
Back in 2014, I met some of the first children in detention centers. 
And I wept. 
I sat in my car afterwards and I cried. 
I was seeing some of the worst suffering I'd ever known, and it went against everything I believed in my country, the rule of law and everything my parents taught me. 
The way the United States has handled the immigrants seeking asylum in our country over the past five years -- it's wrong, just simply wrong. 
Tonight, I want to tell you that children in immigration detention are being traumatized. 
And we are causing the trauma. 
We in America -- actually, those of us here tonight -- will not necessarily be on the same page with respect to immigration. 
We'll disagree on how we're going to handle all those people who want to come to our country. 
Frankly, it doesn't matter to me whether you're a Republican or a Democrat, liberal or conservative. 
I want secure borders. 
I also want to keep the bad actors out. 
I want national security. 
And of course, you'll have your ideas about those topics, too. 
But I think we can agree that America should not be doing harm. 
The government, the state, should not be in the business of hurting children. 
It should be protecting them, no matter whose children they are: your children, my grandchildren and the children of families just looking for asylum. 
Now, I could tell you story after story of children who have witnessed some of the worst violence in the world and are now sitting in detention. 
But two little boys have stayed with me over these past five years. 
One of them was Danny. 
Danny was seven and a half years old when I met him in a detention center in Karnes City, Texas, back in 2014. 
He was there with his mother and his brother, and they had fled Honduras. 
You know, Danny is one of these kids that you get to love instantly. 
He's funny, he's innocent, he's charming and very expressive. 
And he's drawing pictures for me, and one of the pictures he drew for me was of the Revos Locos. 
The Revos Locos: this is the name that they gave to gangs in the town that he was in. 
I said to Danny, "Danny, what makes them bad guys?" 
Danny looked at me with puzzlement. 
I mean, the look was more like, "Are you clueless or just stupid?" 
(Laughter) He leaned in and he whispered, "Don't you see? 
They smoke cigarettes." 
(Laughter) "And they drink beer." 
Danny had learned, of course, about the evils of drinking and smoking. 
Then he said, "And they carry guns." 
In one of the pictures, the stick figures of the Revos Locos are shooting at birds and at people. 
Danny told me about the day his uncle was killed by those Revos Locos and how he ran from his house to his uncle's farmhouse, only to see his uncle's dead body, his face disfigured by bullets. 
And Danny told me he saw his uncle's teeth coming out the back of his head. 
He was only six at the time. 
Sometime after that, one of those Revos Locos beat little Danny badly, severely, and that's when his parents said, "We have got to leave or they will kill us." 
So they set out. 
But Danny's father was a single-leg amputee with a crutch, and he couldn't manage the rugged terrain. 
So he said to his wife, "Go without me. Take our boys. 
Save our boys." 
So Mom and the boys set off. 
Danny told me he looked back, said goodbye to his father, looked back a couple of times until he lost sight of his father. 
In detention, he had not heard from his father. 
And it's very likely that his father was killed by the Revos Locos, because he had tried to flee. 
I can't forget Danny. 
The other boy was Fernando. 
Now, Fernando was in the same detention center, roughly the same age as Danny. 
Fernando was telling me about the 24 hours he spent in isolation with his mother in the detention center, placed there because his mother had led a hunger strike among the mothers in the detention center, and now she was cracking under the pressure of the guards, who were threatening and being very abusive towards her and Fernando. 
As Fernando and I are talking in the small office, his mother burst in, and she says, "They hear you! They're listening to you." 
And she dropped to her hands and knees, and she began to look under the table, groping under all the chairs. 
She looked at the electric sockets, at the corner of the room, the floor, the corner of the ceiling, at the lamp, at the air vent, looking for hidden microphones and cameras. 
I watched Fernando as he watched his mother spiral into this paranoid state. 
I looked in his eyes and I saw utter terror. 
After all, who would take care of him if she couldn't? 
It was just the two of them. They only had each other. 
I could tell you story after story, but I haven't forgotten Fernando. 
And I know something about what that kind of trauma, stress and adversity does to children. 
So I'm going to get clinical with you for a moment, and I'm going to be the professor that I am. 
Under prolonged and intense stress, trauma, hardship, adversity, harsh conditions, the developing brain is harmed, plain and simple. 
Its wiring and its architecture are damaged. 
The child's natural stress response system is affected. 
It's weakened of its protective factors. 
Regions of the brain that are associated with cognition, intellectual abilities, judgment, trust, self-regulation, social interaction, are weakened, sometimes permanently. 
That impairs children's future. 
We also know that under stress, the child's immune system is suppressed, making them susceptible to infections. 
Chronic illnesses, like diabetes, asthma, cardiovascular disease, will follow those children into adulthood and likely shorten their lives. 
Mental health problems are linked to the breakdown of the body. 
I have seen children in detention who have recurrent and disturbing nightmares, night terrors, depression and anxiety, dissociative reactions, hopelessness, suicidal thinking and post-traumatic stress disorders. 
And they regress in their behavior, like the 11-year-old boy who began to wet his bed again after years of continence. 
And the eight-year-old girl who was buckling under the pressure and was insisting that her mother breastfeed her. 
That is what detention does to children. 
Now, you may ask: What do we do? 
What should our government do? 
Well, I'm just a mental health professional, so all I really know is about children's health and development. 
But I have some ideas. 
First, we need to reframe our practices. 
We need to replace fear and hostility with safety and compassion. 
We need to tear down the prison walls, the barbed wire, take away the cages. 
Instead of prison, or prisons, we should create orderly asylum processing centers, campus-like communities where children and families can live together. 
We could take old motels, old army barracks, refit them so that children and parents can live as family units in some safety and normality, where kids can run around. 
In these processing centers, pediatricians, family doctors, dentists and nurses, would be screening, examining, treating and immunizing children, creating records that will follow them to their next medical provider. 
Social workers would be conducting mental health evaluations and providing treatment for those who need it. 
Those social workers would be connecting families to services that they're going to need, wherever they're headed. 
And teachers would be teaching and testing children and documenting their learning so that the teachers at the next school can continue those children's education. 
There's a lot more that we could do in these processing centers. 
A lot more. 
And you probably are thinking, this is pie-in-the-sky stuff. 
Can't blame you. 
Well, let me tell you that refugee camps all over the world are holding families like those in our detention centers, and some of those refugee camps are getting it right far better than we are. 
The United Nations has issued reports describing refugee camps that protect children's health and development. 
Children and parents live in family units and clusters of families are housed together. 
Parents are given work permits so they can earn some money, they're given food vouchers so they can go to the local stores and shop. 
Mothers are brought together to cook healthy meals for the children, and children go to school every day and are taught. 
Afterwards, after school, they go home and they ride bikes, hang out with friends, do homework and explore the world -- all the essentials for child development. 
We can get it right. We have the resources to get it right. 
What we need is the will and the insistence of Americans that we treat children humanely. 
You know, I can't forget Danny or Fernando. 
I wonder where they are today, and I pray that they are healthy and happy. 
They are only two of the many children I met and of the thousands we know about who have been in detention. 
I may be saddened by what's happened to the children, but I'm inspired by them. 
I may cry, as I did, but I admire those children's strength. 
They keep alive my hope and my optimism in the work I do. 
So while we may differ on our approach to immigration, we should be treating children with dignity and respect. 
We should do right by them. 
If we do, we can prepare those children who remain in the United States, prepare them to become productive, engaged members of our society. 
And those who will return to their countries whether voluntarily or not will be prepared to become the teachers, the merchants, the leaders in their country. 
And I hope together all of those children and parents could give testimony to the world about the goodness of our country and our values. 
But we have to get it right. 
So we can agree to disagree on immigration, but I hope we can agree on one thing: that none of us wants to look back at this moment in our history, when we knew we were inflicting lifelong trauma on children, and that we sat back and did nothing. 
That would be the greatest tragedy of all. 
Thank you. 
(Applause) 

[This talk contains mature content] When I was 14, my parents intended to marry me off to a man of their choosing. 
I refused. 
That choice to defy my family shaped everything in my life and set me on the path to become who I am today. 
But it was very painful at times and continues to be so. 
My parents were raised in traditional, uneducated Moroccan families where a girl's main value is measured by her virginity. 
They emigrated to Belgium, and I was born, raised and educated there. 
I did not accept their view of the world. 
When I said no to them, I paid for it dearly in terms of physical and emotional abuse. 
But eventually, I escaped from their home and became a federal police detective who could help protect the rights of others. 
My specialty was investigating cases in counterterrorism, child abduction and homicide. 
I loved that work, and it was extremely fulfilling. 
With my Muslim background, Arabic language skills and an interest in working internationally, I decided to seek new challenges. 
After decades of being a police officer, I was recruited to become an investigator of sexual and gender-based violence as a member of the Justice Rapid Response and UN Women roster. 
Justice Rapid Response is an organization for criminal investigations of mass atrocities. 
They run on both public and private funding and provide evidence and reports to more than 100 participating countries. 
Many countries in conflict are often unable to provide a just process to those who have been victims of mass violence. 
To respond to that, Justice Rapid Response was created in partnership with UN Women. 
Together, Justice Rapid Response and UN Women recruited, trained and certified more than 250 professionals with a specific expertise in sexual and gender-based violence, like me. 
Our investigations are carried out under international law, and our findings eventually become evidence to prosecute war criminals. 
This mechanism provides hope to victims that justice and accountability may someday be found in the wake of war and conflict. 
Let me tell you about the most challenging work I have ever done. 
This was in Iraq. 
Since the rise of the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria, or ISIS, this group has systematically attacked and tortured many religious minorities and ethnicities, such as the Christians, the Shia Turkmen, Shia Muslims, Shia Shabaks and the Yazidis. 
The persecution of the Yazidis has been especially horrific. 
On the 3rd and 15th of August 2014, ISIS attacked approximately 20 villages and towns in Sinjar, Iraq. 
They executed all the males over the age of 14, including the elderly and disabled. 
They divided up the women and girls, raped them and sold them into sexual and domestic slavery. 
One month later, a UN Human Rights Council resolution led to the fact-finding mission on Iraq to investigate and document alleged violations and abuses committed by ISIS and associated groups. 
I was sent to investigate the atrocities committed against the Yazidis, with a focus on sexual and gender-based crimes. 
The Yazidis are a Kurdish-speaking ethnoreligious community based in Northern Iraq. 
Their belief system incorporates aspects of Judaism, Christianity, Islam and Zoroastrianism. 
For hundreds of years, Muslims and Christians who do not understand their beliefs have condemned the Yazidis as devil worshippers. 
ISIS thought of them in this way and vowed to destroy them. 
OK, let's do an experimental thought here. 
I want you to think about your worst sexual experience and recall it in detail. 
Now turn to the person to your right and describe that experience. 
(Laughter) I know it's difficult, eh? 
(Laughter) But, of course, I don't expect you to do that. 
You would all be uncomfortable and embarrassed. 
And so imagine an 11-year-old girl in the Middle East who was not educated about sexuality, who was taken from her comfort zone, her family, who witnessed the execution of her father and brothers, having to describe in detail the rape that she faced in a culture where talking about sexuality is taboo. 
Her only way of recovering her honor is to hide the crime, believe she was married against her will, or deny the events out of shame and fear of being rejected. 
I interviewed a girl who I will call "Ayda." 
She was purchased by an ISIS leader, or emir, together with 13 other girls aged between 11 and 18 years old. 
Amongst the group were her three nieces and two cousins. 
The 14 girls were taken to a house full of ISIS fighters. 
An imam was present who made it clear that their religion was wrong, and the only good path was to accept Islam and marry a Muslim man. 
The emir wrote the names of the girls on 14 small pieces of paper. 
Two ISIS fighters would pick a piece of paper each. 
They would call out the name written on the paper, and those girls were forcibly taken into another room. 
While the emir and the imam heard the two girls screaming as they were being raped, they began laughing. 
Both were telling the other girls that the two girls should enjoy the experience instead of screaming. 
After a while, the girls were brought back into the room. 
They were in shock and were bleeding. 
They confirmed that they had been married and suffered a lot of pain. 
It is important to consider the fact that they had been raised to believe in sexual intercourse with one man in their lifetime: their husband. 
The only connection that they could make in their shocked state is to define their rape as marriage. 
Before the next two girls were taken to be raped, Ayda made a terrifying decision. 
As the oldest of the group, she convinced the emir to let them use the bathroom in order to wash themselves before marriage. 
Ayda had been told by one of the girls that she noticed rat poison in the bathroom. 
The 14 girls decided to end their suffering by drinking the poison. 
Before the poison took full effect, they were discovered by ISIS and taken to the hospital, where they survived. 
ISIS decided to separate the girls and sell them individually. 
Ayda was taken to another house and brutally raped after she attempted again to kill herself with her headscarf. 
She was beaten and raped every two days. 
After four months in captivity, Ayda found the courage to escape. 
She never saw the other 13 girls again. 
I interviewed Ayda multiple times. 
She was willing to speak to me because she had heard from other victims that there was a woman from the UN who understood her complicated culture. 
I looked into her eyes and listened deeply to the stories of her darkest hours. 
We established a personal connection that continues to this day. 
My upbringing made it easy for me to understand her extreme sense of shame and her fear of being rejected. 
These types of investigations are not only about gathering information and evidence, but they're also about victim support. 
The bonds I established with the victims strengthens their confidence and willingness to seek justice. 
As she considered her escape, Ayda, like all Yazidi survivors, faced a dilemma: Should she continue to suffer the abuse of her captors, or would it be better to return home, where she would face shame, rejection and possibly honor killing? 
I know all too well the pain of being rejected by my Moroccan community in Belgium, and I did not want this to happen to the Yazidi community. 
So a group of concerned entities, including the UN, NGOs, politicians and members of the Yazidi community approached a religious leader, Baba Sheikh. 
After many meetings, he realized that these girls had not disrespected their religion by being forcibly converted to Islam and married to ISIS fighters. 
Instead, they have been abducted, raped and sexually enslaved. 
I am happy to report that, after our meetings, Baba Sheikh announced publicly that the survivors should be treated as victims and embraced by the community. 
This message was heard throughout the community and eventually reached the survivors being held captive by ISIS. 
After his declaration of support, the survivors were motivated to escape from ISIS as Ayda has done, and many young Yazidi women took the bold step and returned home to their communities. 
Baba Sheikh's public pronouncement saved the lives of many young Yazidi women, both in captivity and after their escape. 
Sadly, not all religious leaders agreed to talk with us. 
Some victims had far worse outcomes than the Yazidis. 
For example, only 43 of the 500-600 victims from the Shia Turkmen community were able to return home after escaping ISIS. 
Some of them were advised by their family to stay with ISIS or commit suicide in order to save the honor of the family. 
Germany established a project to support survivors of ISIS by providing psychosocial support and housing for 1,100 women and children, including Ayda. 
I visited Ayda several times during my work. 
I am so proud of her and the other victims. 
The progress they have made is remarkable. 
It is really moving to see how many of them, despite their struggles, have benefited from this program. 
The program includes individual and group counseling, art therapy, music therapy, sport activities, language courses, school and other integration efforts. 
What I observed was that removing the victims from an area of conflict to a country at peace had a positive impact on all of them. 
This project caught the attention of other countries, and they were interested to help more Yazidis. 
The Yazidi women and girls still call and text me to tell me about their grades at school, fun trips they've taken, or to inform me about their future dreams, like writing a book about what they have faced with ISIS. 
Sometimes they are sad and feel the need to talk again about the events. 
I'm not a psychologist, and I have faced secondary PTSD from their horrific stories. 
But I keep encouraging them to talk, and I keep listening, because I do not want them to feel alone in their suffering. 
Through these anecdotes, I see a bigger picture emerging. 
These women and girls are healing. 
They are no longer afraid to seek justice. 
Without hope there can be no justice, and without justice there can be no hope. 
Every 3rd and 15th of August, it's my remembrance day, and I reach out to the Yazidis to let them know that I'm thinking about them. 
They're always happy when I do that. 
It's an emotional day for them. 
This past August, I spoke with Ayda. 
She was so happy to announce that one of her nieces who was abducted with her was finally released out of ISIS hands in Syria and returned to Iraq. 
Can you believe that? 
After four years? 
Today, her biggest wish is for her whole family, now located across three continents, to be reunited. 
And I hope they will. 
When I think about the survivors I work with, I remember the words of an Egyptian doctor, writer and human rights activist, Nawal El Saadawi. 
In her book, "Woman at Point Zero," she wrote, "Life is very hard, and the only people who really live are those who are harder than life itself." 
These victims have been through unimaginable pain. 
But with a little help, they show how resilient they are. 
Each has their own perspective on what kind of justice she seeks, and I believe deeply that a credible justice process is key to how she reclaims her dignity and finds closure with her trauma. 
Justice is not only about punishing the perpetrator. 
It's about victims feeling that crimes committed against them have been recorded and recognized by the rule of law. 
For me, it has been the experience of a lifetime to work with these survivors. 
Because I share their sorrow, their language and their culture, we connect on the deepest human level. 
This itself is an act of healing: to be heard, to be seen, to be given compassion instead of condemnation. 
When we get so close to people in pain, it creates pain for the investigators, too. 
My work is challenging, heartbreaking and trauma-inducing. 
But let me tell you why I do it. 
When I meet the survivors of these mass atrocities, when I hold their hands and look in their eyes, it does not erase my own pain, but it does make it almost worthwhile. 
And there's nothing I would rather be doing. 
When I see these brave survivors struggling to connect again to their own self-worth, to their families, to their place in a society that values them, it is an honor to bear witness; it is a privilege to seek justice. 
And that is healing, too -- for all of us. 
Thank you. 
(Applause) 

The archive. 
One may envision rooms and shelves stocked with boxes and cartons of old stuff. 
And yet, for those who are patient enough to dig through it, the archive provides the precious opportunity to touch the past, to feel and learn from the experiences of once-living people who now seem dead and buried deeply in the archive. 
But what if there was a way to bring the archive to life? 
Jon Michael Reese: "The world is thinking wrong about race." 
Melissa Joyner: "This country insists upon judging the Negro." 
JMR: "Because it does not know." 
AYGTK: What if one could make it breathe? 
MJ: "By his lowest and most vicious representatives." 
AYGTK: Speak. 
JMR: "An honest, straightforward exhibit." 
AYGTK: And even sing to us, so that the archive becomes accessible to everyone. 
What would performing the archive look like? 
A performance that is not simply based on a true story but one that allows us to come face-to-face with things we thought were once dead and buried. 
(Piano music) This is what "At Buffalo," a new musical we're developing, is all about. 
Using collections from over 30 archival institutions, "At Buffalo" performs the massive archive of the 1901 Pan-American Exposition, the first World's Fair of the 20th century, held in Buffalo, New York. 
Now, if you've heard of this fair, it might be because this is where then-US president, William McKinley, was assassinated. 
For nearly 17 years, I've stayed inside the gates and the archive of this fair, not only because of that story but because of a real life-and-death racial drama that played out on the fairgrounds. 
Here, in a place that was like Disney World, the Olympics, carnivals, museums, all in one, there were three conflicting displays of what it meant to be black in the United States. 
The archive says white showmen presented a savage black origin in the form of 98 West and Central Africans, living and performing war dances in a recreated village called Darkest Africa. 
And across the street, a happy slave life, in the form of 150 Southern black performers, picking cotton, singing and dancing minstrel shows in a recreated antebellum attraction called Old Plantation. 
As a response, the black Buffalo community championed the third display of blackness: the Negro Exhibit. 
Codesigned by African American scholar W.E.B. Du Bois, it curated photographs, charts, books and more, to show black Americans as a high-achieving race, capable of education and progress. 
When I first encountered this story, I understood from my own life experience what was at stake to have members of the African diaspora see each other like this. 
For me, as the child of immigrant parents from Ghana, West Africa, born in the American South, raised in Manhattan, Kansas, (Laughter) and having attended the same elite school as Du Bois, I could see that the Buffalo fair effectively pitted the black Northerner against the Southerner, the educated against the uneducated, and the African American against the African. 
And I wanted to know: How did these three distinct groups of black folk navigate this experience? 
Unfortunately, the archive had answers to questions like this underneath racial caricature, conflicting information and worse -- silence. 
(Piano music) Still, I could hear musical melodies and see dance numbers and the rhythms of the words coming off the pages of old newspaper articles. 
And learning that this World's Fair had music playing everywhere on its fairgrounds, I knew that live, immersive, spectacular musical theater, with the latest technologies of our time, is the closest experience that can bring the archival story of the 1901 fair out of boxes and into life. 
Stories, like Tannie and Henrietta, a husband and wife vaudeville duo in love who become at odds over performing these "coon" minstrel shows while striving for their five-dollar-a-week dream in the Old Plantation attraction. 
Like African businessman John Tevi, from present-day Togo, who must outwit the savage rules of the human zoo in which he has become trapped. 
And stories like Mary Talbert, a wealthy leader of the black Buffalo elite, who must come to terms with the racial realities of her home town. 
MJ: "The dominant race in this country insists upon judging the Negro by his lowest and most vicious representatives." 
AYGTK: Like Old Plantation and Darkest Africa. 
MJ: "... instead of by the more intelligent and worthy classes." 
AYGTK: When fair directors ignored Mary Talbert and the local black Buffalo community's request to participate in the fair, newspapers say that Mary Talbert and her club of educated African American women held a rousing protest meeting. 
But the details of that meeting, even down to the fiery speech she gave, were not fully captured in the archive. 
So, "At Buffalo" takes the essence of Mary's speech and turns it into song. 
(All singing) We must, we are unanimous. 
We must, we are unanimous. 
MJ: We've got something to show -- we're going to teach a lesson in Buffalo. 
It would benefit the nation to see our growth since emancipation. 
Colored people should be represented in this Pan-American exposition, it would benefit the nation to see our growth since emancipation. 
(All singing) They made a great mistake not to appoint someone from the race. 
We must, we are unanimous. 
We must, we are unanimous. 
We must, we are unanimous. 
AYGTK: Mary Talbert successfully demands that the Negro Exhibit come to the fair. 
And to have the Negro Exhibit in Buffalo means that the musical must tell the story behind why Du Bois cocreated it ... 
and why Mary and the black elite felt it was urgently needed. 
JMR: "The world is thinking wrong about race. 
They killed Sam Hose for who they thought he was. 
And more men like him, every day, more Negro men, like him, taken apart. 
And after that -- that red ray ... 
we can never be the same. 
(Singing) A red ray [A man hunt in Georgia] cut across my desk [Mob after Hose; he will be lynched if caught] the very day Sam's hands were laid to rest. 
Can words alone withstand the laws unjust? 
[Escape seems impossible] Can words alone withstand the violence? 
Oh, no, oh. 
[Burned alive] [Sam Hose is lynched] Oh, no, oh. 
[His body cut in many pieces] Oh, no, oh. 
[Burned at the Stake] [Ten Cents Slice Cooked Liver.] [Fight for souvenirs.] (Both singing) Who has read the books? 
Our numbers and statistics look small against the page. 
The crisis has multiplied. 
Our people are lynched and died. 
Oh, Lord. 
Something must change. 
AYGTK: Something must change. 
"At Buffalo" reveals how the United States today stands at similar crossroads as 1901 America. 
Just as the name of Sam Hose filled newspapers back then, today's media carries the names of: JMR: Oscar Grant. 
MJ: Jacqueline Culp. 
Pianist: Trayvon Martin. 
AYGTK: Sandra Bland. 
And too many others. 
The 1901 fair's legacies persist in more ways than we can imagine. 
MJ: Mary Talbert and the National Association of Colored Women started movements against lynching and the myth of black criminality just as black women today started Black Lives Matter. 
JMR: And some of the same people who fought for and created the Negro Exhibit, including Du Bois, came to Buffalo, four years after the fair, to start the Niagara Movement, which set the groundwork for the creation of the NAACP. 
AYGTK: It's not just black folks who had a peculiar experience at the 1901 fair. 
An official handbook informed fair-goers: MJ: "Please remember:" JMR: "... once you get inside the gate," AYGTK: "... you are a part of the show." 

The second half of the last century was completely defined by a technological revolution: the software revolution. 
The ability to program electrons on a material called silicon made possible technologies, companies and industries that were at one point unimaginable to many of us, but which have now fundamentally changed the way the world works. 
The first half of this century, though, is going to be transformed by a new software revolution: the living software revolution. 
And this will be powered by the ability to program biochemistry on a material called biology. 
And doing so will enable us to harness the properties of biology to generate new kinds of therapies, to repair damaged tissue, to reprogram faulty cells or even build programmable operating systems out of biochemistry. 
If we can realize this -- and we do need to realize it -- its impact will be so enormous that it will make the first software revolution pale in comparison. 
And that's because living software would transform the entirety of medicine, agriculture and energy, and these are sectors that dwarf those dominated by IT. 
Imagine programmable plants that fix nitrogen more effectively or resist emerging fungal pathogens, or even programming crops to be perennial rather than annual so you could double your crop yields each year. 
That would transform agriculture and how we'll keep our growing and global population fed. 
Or imagine programmable immunity, designing and harnessing molecular devices that guide your immune system to detect, eradicate or even prevent disease. 
This would transform medicine and how we'll keep our growing and aging population healthy. 
We already have many of the tools that will make living software a reality. 
We can precisely edit genes with CRISPR. 
We can rewrite the genetic code one base at a time. 
We can even build functioning synthetic circuits out of DNA. 
But figuring out how and when to wield these tools is still a process of trial and error. 
It needs deep expertise, years of specialization. 
And experimental protocols are difficult to discover and all too often, difficult to reproduce. 
And, you know, we have a tendency in biology to focus a lot on the parts, but we all know that something like flying wouldn't be understood by only studying feathers. 
So programming biology is not yet as simple as programming your computer. 
And then to make matters worse, living systems largely bear no resemblance to the engineered systems that you and I program every day. 
In contrast to engineered systems, living systems self-generate, they self-organize, they operate at molecular scales. 
And these molecular-level interactions lead generally to robust macro-scale output. 
They can even self-repair. 
Consider, for example, the humble household plant, like that one sat on your mantelpiece at home that you keep forgetting to water. 
Every day, despite your neglect, that plant has to wake up and figure out how to allocate its resources. 
Will it grow, photosynthesize, produce seeds, or flower? 
And that's a decision that has to be made at the level of the whole organism. 
But a plant doesn't have a brain to figure all of that out. 
It has to make do with the cells on its leaves. 
They have to respond to the environment and make the decisions that affect the whole plant. 
So somehow there must be a program running inside these cells, a program that responds to input signals and cues and shapes what that cell will do. 
And then those programs must operate in a distributed way across individual cells, so that they can coordinate and that plant can grow and flourish. 
If we could understand these biological programs, if we could understand biological computation, it would transform our ability to understand how and why cells do what they do. 
Because, if we understood these programs, we could debug them when things go wrong. 
Or we could learn from them how to design the kind of synthetic circuits that truly exploit the computational power of biochemistry. 
My passion about this idea led me to a career in research at the interface of maths, computer science and biology. 
And in my work, I focus on the concept of biology as computation. 
And that means asking what do cells compute, and how can we uncover these biological programs? 
And I started to ask these questions together with some brilliant collaborators at Microsoft Research and the University of Cambridge, where together we wanted to understand the biological program running inside a unique type of cell: an embryonic stem cell. 
These cells are unique because they're totally naïve. 
They can become anything they want: a brain cell, a heart cell, a bone cell, a lung cell, any adult cell type. 
This naïvety, it sets them apart, but it also ignited the imagination of the scientific community, who realized, if we could tap into that potential, we would have a powerful tool for medicine. 
If we could figure out how these cells make the decision to become one cell type or another, we might be able to harness them to generate cells that we need to repair diseased or damaged tissue. 
But realizing that vision is not without its challenges, not least because these particular cells, they emerge just six days after conception. 
And then within a day or so, they're gone. 
They have set off down the different paths that form all the structures and organs of your adult body. 
But it turns out that cell fates are a lot more plastic than we might have imagined. 
About 13 years ago, some scientists showed something truly revolutionary. 
By inserting just a handful of genes into an adult cell, like one of your skin cells, you can transform that cell back to the naïve state. 
And it's a process that's actually known as "reprogramming," and it allows us to imagine a kind of stem cell utopia, the ability to take a sample of a patient's own cells, transform them back to the naïve state and use those cells to make whatever that patient might need, whether it's brain cells or heart cells. 
But over the last decade or so, figuring out how to change cell fate, it's still a process of trial and error. 
Even in cases where we've uncovered successful experimental protocols, they're still inefficient, and we lack a fundamental understanding of how and why they work. 
If you figured out how to change a stem cell into a heart cell, that hasn't got any way of telling you how to change a stem cell into a brain cell. 
So we wanted to understand the biological program running inside an embryonic stem cell, and understanding the computation performed by a living system starts with asking a devastatingly simple question: What is it that system actually has to do? 
Now, computer science actually has a set of strategies for dealing with what it is the software and hardware are meant to do. 
When you write a program, you code a piece of software, you want that software to run correctly. 
You want performance, functionality. 
You want to prevent bugs. 
They can cost you a lot. 
So when a developer writes a program, they could write down a set of specifications. 
These are what your program should do. 
Maybe it should compare the size of two numbers or order numbers by increasing size. 
Technology exists that allows us automatically to check whether our specifications are satisfied, whether that program does what it should do. 
And so our idea was that in the same way, experimental observations, things we measure in the lab, they correspond to specifications of what the biological program should do. 
So we just needed to figure out a way to encode this new type of specification. 
So let's say you've been busy in the lab and you've been measuring your genes and you've found that if Gene A is active, then Gene B or Gene C seems to be active. 
We can write that observation down as a mathematical expression if we can use the language of logic: If A, then B or C. 
Now, this is a very simple example, OK. 
It's just to illustrate the point. 
We can encode truly rich expressions that actually capture the behavior of multiple genes or proteins over time across multiple different experiments. 
And so by translating our observations into mathematical expression in this way, it becomes possible to test whether or not those observations can emerge from a program of genetic interactions. 
And we developed a tool to do just this. 
We were able to use this tool to encode observations as mathematical expressions, and then that tool would allow us to uncover the genetic program that could explain them all. 
And we then apply this approach to uncover the genetic program running inside embryonic stem cells to see if we could understand how to induce that naïve state. 
And this tool was actually built on a solver that's deployed routinely around the world for conventional software verification. 
So we started with a set of nearly 50 different specifications that we generated from experimental observations of embryonic stem cells. 
And by encoding these observations in this tool, we were able to uncover the first molecular program that could explain all of them. 
Now, that's kind of a feat in and of itself, right? 
Being able to reconcile all of these different observations is not the kind of thing you can do on the back of an envelope, even if you have a really big envelope. 
Because we've got this kind of understanding, we could go one step further. 
We could use this program to predict what this cell might do in conditions we hadn't yet tested. 
We could probe the program in silico. 
And so we did just that: we generated predictions that we tested in the lab, and we found that this program was highly predictive. 
It told us how we could accelerate progress back to the naïve state quickly and efficiently. 
It told us which genes to target to do that, which genes might even hinder that process. 
We even found the program predicted the order in which genes would switch on. 
So this approach really allowed us to uncover the dynamics of what the cells are doing. 
What we've developed, it's not a method that's specific to stem cell biology. 
Rather, it allows us to make sense of the computation being carried out by the cell in the context of genetic interactions. 
So really, it's just one building block. 
The field urgently needs to develop new approaches to understand biological computation more broadly and at different levels, from DNA right through to the flow of information between cells. 
Only this kind of transformative understanding will enable us to harness biology in ways that are predictable and reliable. 
But to program biology, we will also need to develop the kinds of tools and languages that allow both experimentalists and computational scientists to design biological function and have those designs compile down to the machine code of the cell, its biochemistry, so that we could then build those structures. 
Now, that's something akin to a living software compiler, and I'm proud to be part of a team at Microsoft that's working to develop one. 
Though to say it's a grand challenge is kind of an understatement, but if it's realized, it would be the final bridge between software and wetware. 
More broadly, though, programming biology is only going to be possible if we can transform the field into being truly interdisciplinary. 
It needs us to bridge the physical and the life sciences, and scientists from each of these disciplines need to be able to work together with common languages and to have shared scientific questions. 
In the long term, it's worth remembering that many of the giant software companies and the technology that you and I work with every day could hardly have been imagined at the time we first started programming on silicon microchips. 
And if we start now to think about the potential for technology enabled by computational biology, we'll see some of the steps that we need to take along the way to make that a reality. 
Now, there is the sobering thought that this kind of technology could be open to misuse. 
If we're willing to talk about the potential for programming immune cells, we should also be thinking about the potential of bacteria engineered to evade them. 
There might be people willing to do that. 
Now, one reassuring thought in this is that -- well, less so for the scientists -- is that biology is a fragile thing to work with. 
So programming biology is not going to be something you'll be doing in your garden shed. 
But because we're at the outset of this, we can move forward with our eyes wide open. 
We can ask the difficult questions up front, we can put in place the necessary safeguards and, as part of that, we'll have to think about our ethics. 
We'll have to think about putting bounds on the implementation of biological function. 
So as part of this, research in bioethics will have to be a priority. 
It can't be relegated to second place in the excitement of scientific innovation. 
But the ultimate prize, the ultimate destination on this journey, would be breakthrough applications and breakthrough industries in areas from agriculture and medicine to energy and materials and even computing itself. 
Imagine, one day we could be powering the planet sustainably on the ultimate green energy if we could mimic something that plants figured out millennia ago: how to harness the sun's energy with an efficiency that is unparalleled by our current solar cells. 
If we understood that program of quantum interactions that allow plants to absorb sunlight so efficiently, we might be able to translate that into building synthetic DNA circuits that offer the material for better solar cells. 
There are teams and scientists working on the fundamentals of this right now, so perhaps if it got the right attention and the right investment, it could be realized in 10 or 15 years. 
So we are at the beginning of a technological revolution. 
Understanding this ancient type of biological computation is the critical first step. 

So, I have a background in technology and magic. 
And magicians are interesting. 
Their illusions accomplish what technology cannot. 
But what happens when the technology of the day seems almost magical? 
What happens when you can do this? 
(Music) Now, 100 years ago, that would have been the magic of levitation. 
Is it possible to create illusions in a world where technology makes anything possible? 
Jump! 
Now, if you know how the trick is done, where is the illusion? 
But still, our imagination is more powerful than our reasoning, and it's easy to attribute personality to machines. 
These are quadcopters. 
But they are more than mechanical flying machines. 
They analyze the environment around them and react to everything I do. 
At once, algorithms allow these autonomous machines to fly in close formation, aware of each other and aware of me -- mathematics that can be mistaken for intelligence, and intelligence for personality. 
Anthropomorphism: that's the illusion, an illusion created by technology and embroidered by our imagination to become an intelligent flying robot, a machine that appears to be alive. 
(Music plays "Close Encounters of the Third Kind") (Quadcopters make tones) I think they say, "Hello." 
Hey guys! Come on. 
And time to land. 
And that's it. 
Thank you. 
(Applause) OK, guys, time to go home. 
Everybody in here. 
Come on, everybody, quickly, quickly. 
No pushing, everybody can fit. 
There you go, a little bit to the left, a little bit to the right. 
Come on, everybody, everybody, and ... good job! 
(Cheers) Thank you. 
(Applause) Thank you. 
(Applause) 

Tashka Yawanawá (Sharp exhale) (Sharp exhale) (Sharp exhale) (Sharp exhale) (Singing) (Singing ends) (Sharp exhale) I'm Tashka Yawanawá. 
I'm here with my wife. 
I come from the Yawanawá community, which is located in the state of Acre in the Brazilian Amazon. 
Takes some days to arrive here. 
I just did the song to reconnect us to the spirit of the rainforest. 
From immemorial time, my people live in the Yawanawá territory. 
We see this holistic way of how nature is. 
Nature, to us, belongs to the whole of humanity. 
And we Yawanawá see the environment, the forest, as alive. 
But everything is always a challenge. 
Mostly now, because I think many of you know that the Amazon now is on fire. 
That affects all of us. 
Destroying the Amazon does not affect just the indigenous people, because we are all connected. 
Whatever we do in my community, if I burn everything, it's going to affect it here, when the snow comes here at Christmas. 
If you pollute here, it's going to affect it when the rain comes to my country. 
I used to say we all belong to the global village. 
I used to say, Amazon belongs to humanity, and also that humanity needs to take care as the indigenous do in the world. 
And for this reason, today is a time to wake, unite us. 
We Yawanawá are doing our part. 
We take care of Mother Earth. 
And now, I will give to my wife. 
Laura Yawanawá: We are here with our hearts crying. 
I am smiling here, but my heart is crying, because a lot of our forests are being destroyed. 
And I just want to give you a message. 
This crisis is giving humanity two options. 
One option is you help to end, to destroy and exterminate all our forests and all our cultures that go with it. 
Or, we transform this crisis into an opportunity to empower indigenous people, to support indigenous people and to save the rainforest and their cultures. 
And how can you do that? 
We have, the Yawanawá, we created a life plan, which is our strategic planning that tells us the steps of how we want to secure our territory. 
We take care of about 200,000 hectares of rainforest. 
But now it's under threat. 
So this life plan shows the steps for us to secure our land, our biodiversity, our culture, our education. 
I invite you all, I invite all companies, I invite all governments, all civil society, to listen to indigenous peoples, to go back to our roots. 
We have been here for many, many ... for centuries. 
And we have been trying to scream to the world that we need to protect our territory, our nature. 
And you never listen to us. 
Never. 
I guess this crisis is teaching humanity that now you need to listen to us and to support indigenous peoples directly, to support their initiatives directly. 
So that's the message that I would love to leave to you. 
That indigenous people have the answer, and if you want to save the Amazon, we have to take action now. 
TY: (Sharp exhale) (Applause) 

Who remembers this infamous Styrofoam container? 
(Applause) Well, it sure changed me, it changed my company, and it started a revelatory journey about how adversaries can be your best allies. 
You know, back in the late '80s, this Big Mac clamshell was the symbol of a garbage crisis. 
People were really angry. 
For example, thousands of students, young students around the globe were sending letters, blaming McDonald's, because we were using millions of these at that time. 
Now, no one at McDonald's knew anything about environmentally friendly packaging, including me. 
The last 10 years, I was in charge of logistics and truck drivers. 
Then out of nowhere, my boss comes to me and says, "Hey, we want you to save this clamshell for the company and lead the effort to reduce waste within McDonald's." 
I looked at him and I asked him, "What is polystyrene?" 
But it all sounded intriguing to me because it brought me back to my roots. 
You see, I grew up in the late '60s, early '70s, in a time of huge social upheaval in the United States. 
And I was really in tune with the protests, the sit-ins, the anti-Vietnam sentiment, and I really felt there was a need to question authority. 
But as I went into university, I realized that I'm not going to make a living doing this. 
And that whole movement had subsided, and my activist spirit went dormant. 
And I needed to make a living, so I got involved in the business world. 
So, now these students against pollution, who were sending those protest letters to McDonald's, they reminded me of myself 20 years ago. 
They're questioning authority. 
But now, I'm the man. 
(Laughter) I'm the corporate suit. 
I'm the one representing authority. 
And this new thing was emerging called corporate social responsibility, later corporate sustainability, and now I had a chance to make a difference. 
So the beginning of this journey started when McDonald's agreed to a partnership with the Environmental Defense Fund. 
They were an NGO that was founded with the principle of "sue the bastards." 
So I'm thinking, what are they thinking about me and my team? 
When I first met Richard Denison, he's the senior scientist for EDF, I was very apprehensive. 
I thought he's a tree-hugger, and I'm thinking he thinks all I care about is the money. 
So we wanted the EDF team to give us real-world solutions. 
So we did the logical thing. 
We had them flip burgers in our restaurants. 
So you have to imagine Richard, who, by the way, is a PhD in physics, and there he is, he's trying to dress a quarter-pounder, and you're supposed to have two squirts of ketchup, one mustard, three pickles and an onion, go on to the next one, you've got to be so fast. 
And you know what? He couldn't get it right all day long. 
And he was frustrated. 
And I was so impressed, because he was trying to understand our business. 
Now, the EDF team, they thought reusables were the holy grail for our business. 
Me and my team thought, reusables? 
Too much space, they'd make a mess, they would slow us down. 
But we didn't reject the idea. 
We went to the restaurant they chose outside DC, we went to the back room. 
The dishwasher wasn't working properly, it's spitting out dirty dishes. 
The kitchen area is dirty and grimy. 
And compared to their experience at McDonald's that's clean and organized, they could see the stark difference. 
We also sat in a restaurant at McDonald's, all day long, and watched the customers eating in. 
Their behavior. 
Ends up that many customers left with the food, they left with the beverage. 
And EDF came to their own conclusion that reusables wouldn't work for us. 
But they did have a lot of ideas that did work. 
And we never would have thought of them by ourselves, without the EDF team. 
My favorite was switching from the white carry-out bag to the brown bag. 
We had been using the white bag. 
It's virgin material, it's made from chlorine bleaching chemicals, and they said, use an unbleached bag, no chemicals. 
It's made from recycled content, mostly recycled shipping corrugated boxes. 
Ends up that the bag is stronger, the fiber is stronger, it didn't cost us more money. 
It was win-win. 
Another idea they had was that we could reduce our napkin by one inch. 
And make it from recycled office paper. 
I'm thinking, one inch, no big deal. 
We did it, it reduced waste by three million pounds a year. 
Sixteen thousand trees saved. 
(Applause) What was really cool is we changed that bright white napkin, because the recycled content became gray and speckled. 
And we made that look, you know, in tune, in vogue with customers. 
So, I came to really enjoy the time working with the EDF team. 
We had many dinners, late-night discussions, we went to a ball game together. 
We became friends. 
And that's when I learned a life lesson. 
That these NGO crusaders, they're really no different than me. 
They care, they have passion, we're just not different. 
So, we had a six-month partnership that ended up producing a 42-point waste reduction action plan. 
To reduce, reuse, recycle. 
We measured it during the decade of the '90s, and over 10 years we reduced 300 million pounds of waste. 
Now, if you're wondering about that polystyrene clamshell, yeah, we ditched it. 
And luckily, I still had a job. 
And this partnership was so successful that we went on to recycle the idea to work with critics. 
Collaborate with them on solutions that could work for society and for business. 
But could this idea of collaborating work with the most contrarian folks? 
And on issues that are, you know, not within our direct control. 
Like animal rights. 
Now, animal rights, obviously they don't want animals used for meat. 
McDonald's, probably the biggest purchaser of meat in the food service industry. 
So there's a natural conflict there. 
But I thought it would be best to go visit and learn from the most vociferous and vigilant critics we had at that time, which were Henry Spira, head of Animal Rights International, and Peter Singer, who wrote the book "Animal Liberation," which is considered the modern treatise about animal rights. 
You know, I read Peter's book to prepare, I tried to get into his mindset, and I have to admit, it was tough, I'm not becoming a vegan, my company wasn't going that way. 
But I really thought we could learn a lot. 
And so I set up a breakfast meeting in New York City. 
And I remember sitting down, getting ready, and I decided I'm not going to order my favorite, which is you know, bacon and sausage and eggs. 
(Laughter) And I'm just going to stick to the pastries. 
But I have to admit, I was waiting for the adversarial discussion to happen. 
And it never did. 
Henry and Peter were just gracious, they were caring, they were smart, they asked good questions. 
I told them about how working on animal welfare is very tough for McDonald's because our direct suppliers, they only make meat patties. 
The animals are three or four steps removed from our influence. 
And they were very empathetic. 
And while we were so directly opposed in terms of the missions of our organizations, I felt that I had learned a lot. 
And best of all, they gave me a terrific recommendation. 
And that is, they said, "You should work with Dr. Temple Grandin." 
Now, I didn't know her at the time. 
But I tell you, she's the most renowned expert, then and now, on animal behavior. 
And she knows how animals move and how they should react in facilities. 
So I end up meeting her, and she's the very best type of critic, in a sense that she just loves the animals, wants to protect them, but she also understands the reality of the meat business. 
And I'll always remember, I had never been to a slaughterhouse in my life, and so I go with her for my first trip. 
I didn't know what to expect. 
And we find that the animal handlers have electric prods in their hands, and are basically zapping almost every animal in the facility. 
We're both appalled, she's jumping up and down, you'd have to know her, she's saying, "This can't be, this isn't right, we could use flags, we could use plastic bags, we could redesign the corrals for natural behavior." 
Well I set up Temple with our suppliers to set up standards and guidelines. 
And ways to measure her ideas of implementing animal welfare. 
We did this for the next two to five years. 
And it all got integrated, it all got enforced. 
By the way, two of McDonald's suppliers lost business because they didn't meet our standards. 
And best of all, all these standards ended up scaling to the entire industry. 
And no more zapping of those animals. 
Now, what about issues that we're blamed for elsewhere? 
Like deforestation. 
You know, on that issue, I always thought, policy makers and government, that's their role. 
Never thought it would end up in my lap. 
But I remember in early April 2006, I opened up my Blackberry, and I'm reading about Greenpeace campaigners showing up in the UK by the dozens, dressed as chickens, having breakfast at McDonald's and chaining themselves to the chairs and tables. 
So they got a lot of attention, including mine. 
And I was wondering if the report that they had just released, it was called "Eating Up the Amazon." 
And by the way, soy is a key ingredient for chicken feed, and that's the connection to McDonald's. 
So I called my trusted friends at the World Wildlife Fund, I called Conservation International, and I soon learned that the Greenpeace report was accurate. 
So I gathered internal support, and I'll always remember, next day, after that campaign, I called them up, and I said, "We agree with you." 
And I said, "How about working together?" 
So three days later, miraculously, four people from McDonald's, four people from Greenpeace, we're meeting in the London Heathrow airport. 
And I have to say, the first hour was shaky, it wasn't a whole lot of trust in the room. 
But it seemed like everything came together, because each of us wanted to save the Amazon. 
And during our discussions, you couldn't really tell, I don't think, who was from Greenpeace and who was from McDonald's. 
So one of the best things we did is we traveled with them for nine days on a trip through the Amazon, on the Greenpeace airplane, on the Greenpeace boat. 
And I'll always remember, imagine traveling hundreds of miles west of Manaus, the capital city of the Amazon. 
And it's so pristine beauty, there's no man-made structures, there's no roads, not one wire, not one house. 
You would travel east of Manaus and you would see the blatant rainforest destruction. 
So this very unlikely collaboration produced outstanding results. 
By working together, we recruited over a dozen other retailers and suppliers for the same cause. 
And by the way, within three months, a moratorium on these clear-cutting practices was announced by the industry. 
And Greenpeace themselves declared it as a spectacular drop in deforestation and it's been in effect ever since. 
Now, you think these types of collaborations that I've described would be commonplace today. 
But they're not. 
When organizations are battered, the common response is to deny and push back, put out some sort of lame statement and no progress is made at all. 
I say the alternative is really powerful. 
I mean, it's not going to fix every problem, and there's more to do for sure, but this idea of working with critics and trying to do more good for society that actually is good for business, believe me, it's possible. 
But it starts with the idea that you need to assume the best intentions of your critics. 
Just like you have the best intentions. 
And then secondly, you need to look past a lot of these tactics. 
I admit, I did not like a lot of the tactics used on my company. 
But instead, focus on what the truth is, what's the right thing to do, what's the science, what's the facts. 
And lastly, you know, I would say, give the critics the keys. 
Show them the back room. 
Bring them there, don't hide the details, because if you want allies and support, you need to be open and transparent. 
Now, whether you're a corporate suit, whether you're a tree-hugger, I say the next time you're criticized, reach out, listen, learn. 
You'll become better, your organization will become better, and you might make some good friends along the way. 
Thank you. 
(Applause) 

We often hear these days that the immigration system is broken. 
I want to make the case today that our immigration conversation is broken and to suggest some ways that, together, we might build a better one. 
In order to do that, I'm going to propose some new questions about immigration, the United States and the world, questions that might move the borders of the immigration debate. 
I'm not going to begin with the feverish argument that we're currently having, even as the lives and well-being of immigrants are being put at risk at the US border and far beyond it. 
Instead, I'm going to begin with me in graduate school in New Jersey in the mid-1990s, earnestly studying US history, which is what I currently teach as a professor at Vanderbilt University in Nashville, Tennessee. 
And when I wasn't studying, sometimes to avoid writing my dissertation, my friends and I would go into town to hand out neon-colored flyers, protesting legislation that was threatening to take away immigrants' rights. 
Our flyers were sincere, they were well-meaning, they were factually accurate ... 
But I realize now, they were also kind of a problem. 
Here's what they said: "Don't take away immigrant rights to public education, to medical services, to the social safety net. 
They work hard. 
They pay taxes. 
They're law-abiding. 
They use social services less than Americans do. 
They're eager to learn English, and their children serve in the US military all over the world." 
Now, these are, of course, arguments that we hear every day. 
Immigrants and their advocates use them as they confront those who would deny immigrants their rights or even exclude them from society. 
And up to a certain point, it makes perfect sense that these would be the kinds of claims that immigrants' defenders would turn to. 
But in the long term, and maybe even in the short term, I think these arguments can be counterproductive. 
Why? 
Because it's always an uphill battle to defend yourself on your opponent's terrain. 
And, unwittingly, the handouts my friends and I were handing out and the versions of these arguments that we hear today were actually playing the anti-immigrants game. 
We were playing that game in part by envisioning that immigrants were outsiders, rather than, as I'm hoping to suggest in a few minutes, people that are already, in important ways, on the inside. 
It's those who are hostile to immigrants, the nativists, who have succeeded in framing the immigration debate around three main questions. 
First, there's the question of whether immigrants can be useful tools. 
How can we use immigrants? 
Will they make us richer and stronger? 
The nativist answer to this question is no, immigrants have little or nothing to offer. 
The second question is whether immigrants are others. 
Can immigrants become more like us? 
Are they capable of becoming more like us? 
Are they capable of assimilating? 
Are they willing to assimilate? 
Here, again, the nativist answer is no, immigrants are permanently different from us and inferior to us. 
And the third question is whether immigrants are parasites. 
Are they dangerous to us? And will they drain our resources? 
Here, the nativist answer is yes and yes, immigrants pose a threat and they sap our wealth. 
I would suggest that these three questions and the nativist animus behind them have succeeded in framing the larger contours of the immigration debate. 
These questions are anti-immigrant and nativist at their core, built around a kind of hierarchical division of insiders and outsiders, us and them, in which only we matter, and they don't. 
And what gives these questions traction and power beyond the circle of committed nativists is the way they tap into an everyday, seemingly harmless sense of national belonging and activate it, heighten it and inflame it. 
Nativists commit themselves to making stark distinctions between insiders and outsiders. 
But the distinction itself is at the heart of the way nations define themselves. 
The fissures between inside and outside, which often run deepest along lines of race and religion, are always there to be deepened and exploited. 
And that potentially gives nativist approaches resonance far beyond those who consider themselves anti-immigrant, and remarkably, even among some who consider themselves pro-immigrant. 
So, for example, when Immigrants Act allies answer these questions the nativists are posing, they take them seriously. 
They legitimate those questions and, to some extent, the anti-immigrant assumptions that are behind them. 
When we take these questions seriously without even knowing it, we're reinforcing the closed, exclusionary borders of the immigration conversation. 
So how did we get here? 
How did these become the leading ways that we talk about immigration? 
Here, we need some backstory, which is where my history training comes in. 
During the first century of the US's status as an independent nation, it did very little to restrict immigration at the national level. 
In fact, many policymakers and employers worked hard to recruit immigrants to build up industry and to serve as settlers, to seize the continent. 
But after the Civil War, nativist voices rose in volume and in power. 
The Asian, Latin American, Caribbean and European immigrants who dug Americans' canals, cooked their dinners, fought their wars and put their children to bed at night were met with a new and intense xenophobia, which cast immigrants as permanent outsiders who should never be allowed to become insiders. 
By the mid-1920s, the nativists had won, erecting racist laws that closed out untold numbers of vulnerable immigrants and refugees. 
Immigrants and their allies did their best to fight back, but they found themselves on the defensive, caught in some ways in the nativists' frames. 
When nativists said that immigrants weren't useful, their allies said yes, they are. 
When nativists accused immigrants of being others, their allies promised that they would assimilate. 
When nativists charged that immigrants were dangerous parasites, their allies emphasized their loyalty, their obedience, their hard work and their thrift. 
Even as advocates welcomed immigrants, many still regarded immigrants as outsiders to be pitied, to be rescued, to be uplifted and to be tolerated, but never fully brought inside as equals in rights and respect. 
After World War II, and especially from the mid-1960s until really recently, immigrants and their allies turned the tide, overthrowing mid-20th century restriction and winning instead a new system that prioritized family reunification, the admission of refugees and the admission of those with special skills. 
But even then, they didn't succeed in fundamentally changing the terms of the debate, and so that framework endured, ready to be taken up again in our own convulsive moment. 
That conversation is broken. 
The old questions are harmful and divisive. 
So how do we get from that conversation to one that's more likely to get us closer to a world that is fairer, that is more just, that's more secure? 
I want to suggest that what we have to do is one of the hardest things that any society can do: to redraw the boundaries of who counts, of whose life, whose rights and whose thriving matters. 
We need to redraw the boundaries. 
We need to redraw the borders of us. 
In order to do that, we need to first take on a worldview that's widely held but also seriously flawed. 
According to that worldview, there's the inside of the national boundaries, inside the nation, which is where we live, work and mind our own business. 
And then there's the outside; there's everywhere else. 
According to this worldview, when immigrants cross into the nation, they're moving from the outside to the inside, but they remain outsiders. 
Any power or resources they receive are gifts from us rather than rights. 
Now, it's not hard to see why this is such a commonly held worldview. 
It's reinforced in everyday ways that we talk and act and behave, down to the bordered maps that we hang up in our schoolrooms. 
The problem with this worldview is that it just doesn't correspond to the way the world actually works, and the way it has worked in the past. 
Of course, American workers have built up wealth in society. 
But so have immigrants, particularly in parts of the American economy that are indispensable and where few Americans work, like agriculture. 
Since the nation's founding, Americans have been inside the American workforce. 
Of course, Americans have built up institutions in society that guarantee rights. 
But so have immigrants. 
They've been there during every major social movement, like civil rights and organized labor, that have fought to expand rights in society for everyone. 
So immigrants are already inside the struggle for rights, democracy and freedom. 
And finally, Americans and other citizens of the Global North haven't minded their own business, and they haven't stayed within their own borders. 
They haven't respected other nations' borders. 
They've gone out into the world with their armies, they've taken over territories and resources, and they've extracted enormous profits from many of the countries that immigrants are from. 
In this sense, many immigrants are actually already inside American power. 
With this different map of inside and outside in mind, the question isn't whether receiving countries are going to let immigrants in. 
They're already in. 
The question is whether the United States and other countries are going to give immigrants access to the rights and resources that their work, their activism and their home countries have already played a fundamental role in creating. 
With this new map in mind, we can turn to a set of tough, new, urgently needed questions, radically different from the ones we've asked before -- questions that might change the borders of the immigration debate. 
Our three questions are about workers' rights, about responsibility and about equality. 
First, we need to be asking about workers' rights. 
How do existing policies make it harder for immigrants to defend themselves and easier for them to be exploited, driving down wages, rights and protections for everyone? 
When immigrants are threatened with roundups, detention and deportations, their employers know that they can be abused, that they can be told that if they fight back, they'll be turned over to ICE. 
When employers know that they can terrorize an immigrant with his lack of papers, it makes that worker hyper-exploitable, and that has impacts not only for immigrant workers but for all workers. 
Second, we need to ask questions about responsibility. 
What role have rich, powerful countries like the United States played in making it hard or impossible for immigrants to stay in their home countries? 
Picking up and moving from your country is difficult and dangerous, but many immigrants simply do not have the option of staying home if they want to survive. 
Wars, trade agreements and consumer habits rooted in the Global North play a major and devastating role here. 
What responsibilities do the United States, the European Union and China -- the world's leading carbon emitters -- have to the millions of people already uprooted by global warming? 
And third, we need to ask questions about equality. 
Global inequality is a wrenching, intensifying problem. 
Income and wealth gaps are widening around the world. 
Increasingly, what determines whether you're rich or poor, more than anything else, is what country you're born in, which might seem great if you're from a prosperous country. 
But it actually means a profoundly unjust distribution of the chances for a long, healthy, fulfilling life. 
When immigrants send money or goods home to their family, it plays a significant role in narrowing these gaps, if a very incomplete one. 
It does more than all of the foreign aid programs in the world combined. 
We began with the nativist questions, about immigrants as tools, as others and as parasites. 
Where might these new questions about worker rights, about responsibility and about equality take us? 
These questions reject pity, and they embrace justice. 
These questions reject the nativist and nationalist division of us versus them. 
They're going to help prepare us for problems that are coming and problems like global warming that are already upon us. 
It's not going to be easy to turn away from the questions that we've been asking towards this new set of questions. 
It's no small challenge to take on and broaden the borders of us. 
It will take wit, inventiveness and courage. 
The old questions have been with us for a long time, and they're not going to give way on their own, and they're not going to give way overnight. 
And even if we manage to change the questions, the answers are going to be complicated, and they're going to require sacrifices and tradeoffs. 
And in an unequal world, we're always going to have to pay attention to the question of who has the power to join the conversation and who doesn't. 
But the borders of the immigration debate can be moved. 
It's up to all of us to move them. 
Thank you. 
(Applause) 

Shah Rukh Khan: Courage, determination, and a single-minded vision. 
These are the qualities the biggest achievers have in common. 
These are those brave hearts for whom failure is not an option. 
What looks to us an unconquerable sea, to our next speaker is an irresistible stage she was born to perform on. 
So let's dive straight into the story of our fearless speaker, Bhakti Sharma, who's making waves in the world of long-distance swimming. 
Bhakti Sharma. 
(Applause) Bhakti Sharma: Imagine, in the scorching Rajasthan heat, on a hot summer afternoon, a two-and-a-half-year-old riding on a moped behind her mom, not knowing where they were headed. 
And 20 minutes later, that two-and-a-half-year-old finds herself completely submerged in water. 
Before I knew it, I would be kicking, splashing, screaming, gulping down water, holding onto my mom for my dear life. 
That's how I learned how to swim. 
I started pool-swimming when I was two and a half, and open water swimming when I was 14 years old. 
And so I have given over 25 years of my life to this sport, during which I have swum in all five oceans of the world, crossed the English Channel -- which is also known as the Mount Everest of swimming -- and set a world record in the freezing Antarctic ocean. 
(Applause) When you spend so much time with a sport, it ceases to be just that and becomes a mirror. 
And that shows who you really are. 
You see that your mettle as an athlete is not only tested on race day but every single day, when the sport demands that you get up at 4:30 in the morning, swim for two hours, go to school, come back, swim for three hours, go home, eat and sleep. 
When you win a medal or set a world record, this mirror shows the happiness that you and your loved ones feel, but also reflects the tears that you shed all by yourself, alone in the water. 
Open water swimming is a very lonely sport. 
I have spent hours looking into the infinite, seemingly bottomless ocean underneath me, with nothing to keep me company but my own thoughts. 
And so, I have not only been tested as a swimmer but also as a thinking, feeling, imaginative human being. 
Be it my first test as a marathon swimmer, when I decided to swim for 12 hours non-stop in a swimming pool or crossing the English Channel in 13 hours and 55 minutes. 
When you're swimming, you don't talk, you don't hear very well, and your vision is restricted to what's right in front of you or underneath you. 
This isolation has been my sport's biggest gift to me. 
Through open water swimming, I have come to know myself in ways that I could have never expected to. 
I remember, at the age of 14, when I jumped into an ocean for the first time for a swim, and throughout this swim, the waves were picking me up and throwing me down, I saw the child in me, who enjoys such adventures. 
While crossing the English Channel, after already having swam for 10 hours, when I got stuck in one place for one and a half hour because of the currents, I saw the strong and dedicated athlete in me, who did not want to disappoint her parents or her country. 
In an open water marathon held in Switzerland, when I won my first gold medal for India -- (Applause) I witnessed a proud Indian in me. 
While crossing the English Channel again, this time in a relay with my mother, not knowing that we were creating history, I saw the protective daughter in me, who just wanted to see her mom fulfill her own dreams. 
And four years ago, when I jumped into the Antarctic Ocean, wearing nothing but a swimsuit, cap and goggles, with an unwavering spirit of just doing, I saw a fighter in me. 
When I jumped into that zero-to-one-degree-Celsius water, I realized that I had prepared my body and mind for the cold, but what I wasn't prepared for was the density of the water. 
Every stroke felt like pulling through oil. 
And in the first five minutes, I had that paralyzing thought of just giving up. 
How nice it would be to just forget about all this, get on the boat, stand underneath the hot shower or wrap myself in a warm blanket? 
But with that thought, also came a stronger, a more willful voice from deep within. 
"You know you have it in you to just take one more stroke." 
So I lifted my arm and took a stroke. 
"Now one more." 
So I took a second and a third stroke. 
By the fourth one, I saw a penguin swimming underneath my stomach. 
It came up to my left and started swimming with me. 
"See? A penguin is cheering you on," said that voice within. 
(Applause and cheers) I looked up to my people on the boat. 
They had the same smile on their faces that I had on mine. 
The same smile that we all have when we are stuck in a difficult situation and we see a ray of hope. 
We take it as a sign from destiny, and we just keep pushing forward. 
Just as I did, and 41 minutes later, set the world record for swimming the longest distance in the Antarctic Ocean. 
(Applause) Imagine, it doesn't even snow in Rajasthan. 
(Laughter) That voice, which has accompanied me through all my difficult situations throughout my swims, would have never shown itself if I had not spent so much time alone, had not paid attention to every single thought that crossed my mind. 
When you find yourself alone in an ocean, with your thoughts, the dangers that you face are not just external, like whales, sharks, jellyfish or even demotivating people. 
But the more dangerous demons you face are the fear and negativity inside you that tell you, "You're not good enough. 
You will never reach the other shore. 
You haven't trained enough. 
What if you fail? What will people think? 
I'm sure everybody is thinking right now how slow you are." 
We all have our own internal demons, don't we? 
In a day-to-day life, you can hide from them, behind your work or many other distractions. 
But like I said, in the middle of the ocean, there is nowhere to hide. 
I have to face my internal demons, just as much as I have to taste the salt in the sea, feel the chafing on my skin, and acknowledge the whales swimming beside me. 
I hate it, and I love it. 
I hate it because this sport shows me the side of myself that I don't want to believe exists. 
The side of me that is human and not perfect. 
Like the part of me that can't get out of bed in the morning and make it to practice. 
The side of me that gets so burned out, so tired, that just wants to quit swimming. 
But I also love it, because this sport has given me moments that I can look back on when I feel unmotivated. 
And they bring me to my knees, because I feel so grateful. 
Many of you may not spend hours swimming non-stop. 
But who do you spend the most amount of your time with? 
You may share your external space with many others, but there is one constant companion that you all have: you. 
And yet, most of us may never come to knowing who we really are. 
I'm a daughter, an Indian, a swimmer, a student. 
But I am so much more. 
If you are not investing in yourself, not setting a path that brings you closer to you, no amount of "success" in life can bring you lasting joy or satisfaction. 
Even today, when I can't find motivation or joy in what I'm doing, all I ask myself is, "Is this the best I can do right now?" 
And the meaning of my "best" changes. 
On some days, it means not giving up, continuing to swim in freezing water and setting a world record. 
But on many other days, it means getting over my depressing thoughts, stepping out of the house and being able to do the daily chores. 
What does not change is that voice within. 
That internal compass which guides me to a better self every day. 
And I believe that a truly successful life is the one which is spent in the pursuit of becoming the best possible version of yourself when you take that last breath. 
Thank you. 
(Applause) SRK: I think the only sport I can't do is swim -- I sink like a rock. 
So standing next to the world's best swimmer makes me kind of feel -- if you can excuse my pun -- kind of at sea. 
But -- BS: (Laughs) No pun intended, of course. 
SRK: But what is your next goal as a swimmer? 
BS: I have a major fear of competition, so what better goal to set than aiming for the Olympics? 
Because open water swimming is an Olympic sport now. 
(Applause) Even saying it out loud gives me shivers, because it's such a huge goal that I don't want to accept that I have set that goal, but that's the thrill of it, that's the part of it. 
And my idea is that if I make it to the Olympics or I don't make it, that doesn't matter, but in the process of training for it, I will have become a better swimmer and a better person. 
SRK: Inshallah, you will make it to the Olympics. 
And I want to tell you a lot of people who are watching this show at home, there's lots of people, all of whom are thinking only positively for you, so when you go for the Olympics, imagine all of us will be wearing our penguin suits and swimming with you, and saying, "Go on, go on, Bhakti, go on, go on." 
BS: Can you be my personal penguin? 
SRK: I am your penguin now. 
It would have been cooler if you said, like, a shark and all, but penguin -- BS: Orcas are my spirit animal, but you can be my orca. 
(Applause) SRK: Ladies and gentleman, Bhakti. 
BS: Thank you. 
(Applause) 

I'm an astronaut. 
I flew on the space shuttle twice, and I lived on the International Space Station for almost six months. 
People often ask me the same question, which is, "What's it like in space?" 
as if it was a secret. 
Space belongs to all of us, and I'd like to help you understand why it's a place that is magic for all of us. 
The day after my 50th birthday, I climbed aboard a Russian capsule, in Russia, and launched into space. 
Launching is the most dangerous thing that we do, and it's also the most thrilling. 
Three, two, one ... liftoff! 
I felt every single bit of the controlled fury of those rocket engines as they blasted us off the Earth. 
We went faster and faster and faster, until, after eight and a half minutes, on purpose, those engines stop -- kabunk! -- and we are weightless. 
And the mission and the magic begin. 
Dmitry and Paolo and I are circling the Earth in our tiny spacecraft, approaching the space station carefully. 
It's an intricate dance at 17,500 miles an hour between our capsule, the size of a Smart Car, and the space station, the size of a football field. 
We arrive when those two craft dock with a gentle thunk. 
We open the hatches, have sloppy zero-G hugs with each other, and now we're six. 
We're a space family, an instant family. 
My favorite part about living up there was the flying. 
I loved it. 
It was like being Peter Pan. 
It's not about floating. 
Just the touch of a finger can actually push you across the entire space station, and then you sort of tuck in with your toes. 
One of my favorite things was drifting silently through the space station, which was humming along at night. 
I wondered sometimes if it knew I was there, just silent. 
But sharing the wonder of that with the crew was also part of what was important to me. 
A typical day in space starts with the perfect commute. 
I wake up, cruise down the lab and say hello to the best morning view ever. 
It's a really fast commute, only 30 seconds, and we never get tired of looking out that window. 
I think it reminds us that we're actually still very close to Earth. 
Our crew was the second ever to use the Canadian robotic arm to capture a supply ship the size of a school bus containing about a dozen different experiments and the only chocolate that we would see for the next four months. 
Now, chocolate aside, every single one of those experiments enables yet one more scientific question answered that we can't do down here on Earth. 
And so, it's like a different lens, allowing us to see the answers to questions like, "What about combustion?" 
"What about fluid dynamics?" 
Now, sleeping is delightful. 
My favorite -- I mean, you could be upside down, right side up -- my favorite: curled up in a little ball and floating freely. 
Laundry? Nope. 
We load our dirty clothes into an empty supply ship and send it off into space. 
The bathroom. 
Everyone wants to know. 
It's hard to understand, so I made a little video, because I wanted kids to understand that the principle of vacuum saves the day and that just a gentle breeze helps everything go where it is supposed to. 
Well, in real life it does. 
(Laughter) Recycling? Of course. 
So we take our urine, we store it, we filter it and then we drink it. 
And it's actually delicious. 
(Laughter) Sitting around the table, eating food that looks bad but actually tastes pretty good. 
But it's the gathering around the table that's important, I think both in space and on Earth, because that's what cements a crew together. 
For me, music was a way to stay connected to the rest of the world. 
I played a duet between Earth and space with Ian Anderson of Jethro Tull on the 50th anniversary of human spaceflight. 
Connecting to family was so important. 
I talked with my family almost every day the whole time I was up there, and I would actually read books to my son as a way for us just to be together. 
So important. 
Now, when the space station would go over Massachusetts, my family would run outside, and they would watch the brightest star sailing across the sky. 
And when I looked down, I couldn't see my house, but it meant a lot to me to know that the people I loved the most were looking up while I was looking down. 
So the space station, for me, is the place where mission and magic come together. 
The mission, the work are vital steps in our quest to go further than our planet and imperative for understanding sustainability here on Earth. 
I loved being a part of that, and if I could have taken my family with me, I never would have come home. 
And so my view from the station showed me that we are all from the same place. 
We all have our roles to play. 
Because, the Earth is our ship. 
Space is our home. 
And we are the crew of Spaceship Earth. 
Thank you. 
(Applause) 

Twice a week, I drive from my home near Tijuana, Mexico, over the US border, to my office in San Diego. 
The stark contrast between the poverty and desperation on one side of the border and the conspicuous wealth on the other always feels jarring. 
But what makes this contrast feel even starker is when I pass by the building that those of us who work on the border unaffectionately refer to as the black hole. 
The black hole is the Customs and Border Protection, or CBP facility, at the San Ysidro port of entry, right next to a luxury outlet mall. 
It's also where, at any one time, there's likely 800 immigrants locked in freezing, filthy, concrete cells below the building. 
Up top: shopping bags and frappuccinos. 
Downstairs: the reality of the US immigration system. 
And it's where, one day in September of 2018, I found myself trying to reach Anna, a woman who CBP had recently separated from her seven-year-old son. 
I'm an immigration attorney and the policy and litigation director of Al Otro Lado, a binational nonprofit helping immigrants on both sides of the US-Mexico border. 
We'd met Anna several weeks earlier at our Tijuana office, where she explained that she feared she and her son would be killed in Mexico. 
So we prepared her for the process of turning herself over to CBP to ask for asylum. 
A few days after she'd gone to the port of entry to ask for help, we received a frantic phone call from her family members in the United States, telling us that CBP officials had taken Anna's son from her. 
Now, not that this should matter, but I knew that Anna's son had special needs. 
And once again, this news filled me with the sense of panic and foreboding that has unfortunately become a hallmark of my daily work. 
I had a signed authorization to act as Anna's attorney, so I rushed over to the port of entry to see if I could speak with my client. 
Not only would CBP officials not let me speak to Anna, but they wouldn't even tell me if she was there. 
I went from supervisor to supervisor, begging to submit evidence of Anna's son's special needs, but no one would even talk to me about the case. 
It felt surreal to watch the shoppers strolling idly by what felt like a life-and-death situation. 
After several hours of being stonewalled by CBP, I left. 
Several days later, I found Anna's son in the foster-care system. 
But I didn't know what happened to Anna until over a week later, when she turned up at a detention camp a few miles east. 
Now, Anna didn't have a criminal record, and she followed the law when asking for asylum. 
Still, immigration officials held her for three more months, until we could win her release and help her reunify with her son. 
Anna's story is not the only story I could tell you. 
There's Mateo, an 18-month-old boy, who was ripped from his father's arms and sent to a government shelter thousands of miles away, where they failed to properly bathe him for months. 
There's Amadou, an unaccompanied African child, who was held with adults for 28 days in CBP's horrific facilities. 
Most disturbingly, there's Maria, a pregnant refugee who begged for medical attention for eight hours before she miscarried in CBP custody. 
CBP officials held her for three more weeks before they sent her back to Mexico, where she is being forced to wait months for an asylum hearing in the United States. 
Seeing these horrors day in and day out has changed me. 
I used to be fun at parties, but now, I inevitably find myself telling people about how our government tortures refugees at the border and in the detention camps. 
Now, people try to change the subject and congratulate me for the great work I'm doing in helping people like Anna. 
But I don't know how to make them understand that unless they start fighting, harder than they ever thought possible, we don't know which of us will be the next to suffer Anna's fate. 
Trump's mass separations of refugee families at the southern border shocked the conscience of the world and woke many to the cruelties of the US immigration system. 
It seems like today, more people than ever are involved in the fight for immigrant rights. 
But unfortunately, the situation is just not getting better. 
Thousands protested to end family separations, but the government is still separating families. 
More than 900 children have been taken from their parents since June of 2018. 
Thousands more refugee children have been taken from their grandparents, siblings and other family members at the border. 
Since 2017, at least two dozen people have died in immigration custody. 
And more will die, including children. 
Now, we lawyers can and will keep filing lawsuits to stop the government from brutalizing our clients, but we can't keep tinkering around the edges of the law if we want migrants to be treated humanely. 
This administration would have you believe that we have to separate families and we have to detain children, because it will stop more refugees from coming to our borders. 
But we know that this isn't true. 
In fact, in 2019, the number of apprehensions at our southern border has actually gone up. 
And we tell people every day at the border, "If you seek asylum in the United States, you risk family separation, and you risk being detained indefinitely." 
But for many of them, the alternative is even worse. 
People seek refuge in the United States for a lot of different reasons. 
In Tijuana, we've met refugees from over 50 countries, speaking 14 different languages. 
We meet LGBT migrants from all over the world who have never been in a country in which they feel safe. 
We meet women from all over the world whose own governments refuse to protect them from brutal domestic violence or repressive social norms. 
Of course, we meet Central American families who are fleeing gang violence. 
But we also meet Russian dissidents, Venezuelan activists, Christians from China, Muslims from China, and thousands and thousands of other refugees fleeing all types of persecution and torture. 
Now, a lot of these people would qualify as refugees under the international legal definition. 
The Refugee Convention was created after World War II to give protection to people fleeing persecution based on their race, religion, nationality, political opinion or membership in a particular social group. 
But even those who would be refugees under the international definition are not going to win asylum in the United States. 
And that's because since 2017, the US Attorneys General have made sweeping changes to asylum law, to make sure that less people qualify for protection in the United States. 
Now these laws are mostly aimed at Central Americans and keeping them out of the country, but they affect other types of refugees as well. 
The result is that the US frequently deports refugees to their persecution and death. 
The US is also using detention to try to deter refugees and make it harder for them to win their cases. 
Today, there are over 55,000 immigrants detained in the United States, many in remote detention facilities, far from any type of legal help. 
And this is very important. 
Because it's civil and not criminal detention, there is no public defender system, so most detained immigrants are not going to have an attorney to help them with their cases. 
An immigrant who has an attorney is up to 10 times more likely to win their case than one who doesn't. 
And as you've seen, I hate to be the bearer of bad news, but the situation is even worse for refugee families today than it was during family separation. 
Since January of 2019, the US has implemented a policy that's forced over 40,000 refugees to wait in Mexico for asylum hearings in the United States. 
These refugees, many of whom are families, are trapped in some of the most dangerous cities in the world, where they're being raped, kidnapped and extorted by criminal groups. 
And if they survive for long enough to make it to their asylum hearing, less than one percent of them are able to find an attorney to help them with their cases. 
The US government will point to the lowest asylum approval rates to argue that these people are not really refugees, when in fact, US asylum law is an obstacle course designed to make them fail. 
Now not every migrant at the border is a refugee. 
I meet plenty of economic migrants. 
For example, people who want to go to the United States to work, to pay medical bills for a parent or school fees for a child back home. 
Increasingly, I'm also meeting climate refugees. 
In particular, I'm meeting a lot of indigenous Central Americans who can no longer sustain themselves by farming, due to catastrophic drought in the region. 
We know that today, people are migrating because of climate change, and that more will do so in the future, but we simply don't have a legal system to deal with this type of migration. 
So, it would make sense, as a start, to expand the refugee definition to include climate refugees, for example. 
But those of us in a position to advocate for those changes are too busy suing our government to keep the meager legal protections that refugees enjoy under the current law. 
And we are exhausted, and it's almost too late to help. 
And we know now that this isn't America's problem alone. 
From Australia's brutal offshore detention camps to Italy's criminalization of aid to migrants drowning in the Mediterranean, first-world countries have gone to deadly lengths to keep refugees from reaching our shores. 
But they've done more than restrict the refugee definition. 
They've created parallel, fascist-style legal systems in which migrants have none of the rights that form the basis of a democracy, the alleged foundation of the countries in which they're seeking refuge. 
History shows us that the first group to be vilified and stripped of their rights is rarely the last, and many Americans and Europeans seem to accept an opaque and unjust legal system for noncitizens, because they think they are immune. 
But eventually, these authoritarian ideals bleed over and affect citizens as well. 
I learned this firsthand when the US government placed me on an illegal watch list for my work helping immigrants at the border. 
One day, in January of 2019, I was leaving my office in San Diego and crossing the border to go back to my home in Mexico. 
Mexican officials, although they had given me a valid visa, stopped me and told me that I couldn't enter the country because a foreign government had placed a travel alert on my passport, designating me as a national security risk. 
I was detained and interrogated in a filthy room for hours. 
I begged the Mexican officials to let me go back to Mexico and pick up my son, who was only 10 months old at the time. 
But they refused, and instead, they turned me over to CBP officials, where I was forced back into the United States. 
It took me weeks to get another visa so that I could go back to Mexico, and I went to the border, visa in hand. 
But again, I was detained and interrogated because there was still a travel alert on my passport. 
Shortly after, leaked internal CBP documents confirmed that my own government had been complicit in issuing this travel alert against me. 
And since then, I haven't traveled to any other countries, because I'm afraid I'll be detained and deported from those countries as well. 
These travel restrictions, detentions and separation from my infant son are things I never thought I would experience as a US citizen, but I'm far from the only person being criminalized for helping immigrants. 
The US and other countries have made it a crime to save lives, and those of us who are simply trying to do our jobs are being forced to choose between our humanity and our freedom. 
And the thing that makes me so desperate is that all of you are facing the same choice, but you don't understand it yet. 
And I know there are good people out there. 
I saw thousands of you in the streets, protesting family separation. 
And that largely helped bring about an end to the official policy. 
But we know that the government is still separating children. 
And things are actually getting worse. 
Today, the US government is fighting for the right to detain refugee children indefinitely in prison camps. 
This isn't over. 
We cannot allow ourselves to become numb or look away. 
Those of us who are citizens of countries whose policies cause detention, separation and death, need to very quickly decide which side we're on. 
We need to demand that our laws respect the inherent dignity of all human beings, especially refugees seeking help at our borders, but including economic migrants and climate refugees. 
We need to demand that refugees get a fair shot at seeking protection in our countries by ensuring that they have access to council and by creating independent courts that are not subject to the political whims of the president. 
I know it's overwhelming, and I know this sounds cliché, but ... 
we need to call our elected representatives and demand these changes. 
I know you've heard this before, but have you made the call? 
We know these calls make a difference. 
The dystopian immigration systems being built up in first-world countries are a test of citizens to see how far you're willing to let the government go in taking away other people's rights when you think it won't happen to you. 
But when you let the government take people's children without due process and detain people indefinitely without access to council, you are failing the test. 
What's happening to immigrants now is a preview of where we're all headed if we fail to act. 
Thank you. 
(Applause) 

Like a lot of people around the world, earlier this summer my friends and I were obsessed with the Women's World Cup held in France. 
Here we are, watching these incredible athletes, the goals were amazing, the games were clean and engaging, and at the same time, outside the field, these women are talking about equal pay, and in the case of some countries, any pay at all for their sport. 
So because we were mildly obsessed, we wanted to watch the games live, and we decided that one of the Spanish-speaking networks in the US was the best place for us to start. 
And it wasn't until a few games into the tournament that a friend of mine talks to me and says, "Why does it feel like everything I'm seeing is commercials for makeup and household cleaning products and diets?" 
It did feel a little bit too obvious, and I don't know if we were sensitive about it or the fact that we were watching with men and boys in our lives, but it did feel a little bit too obvious that we're being targeted for being women. 
And to be honest there's nothing necessarily wrong with that. 
Someone sat down and looked at the tournament and said, "Well, this thing is likely to be seen by more women, these women are Hispanic because they're watching in Spanish, and this is women content. 
Therefore, this is a great place for me to place all these commercials that are female-centric and maybe not other things." 
If I think about it as a marketer, I know that I absolutely should not be annoyed about it, because this is what marketers are tasked with doing. 
Marketers are tasked with building brands with very limited budget, so there's a little bit of an incentive to categorize people in buckets so they can reach their target faster. 
So if you think about this, it's kind of like a shortcut. 
They're using gender as a shortcut to get to their target consumer. 
The issue is that as logical as that argument seems, gender as a shortcut is actually not great. 
In this day and age, if you still blindly use a gender view for your marketing activities, actually it's just plain bad business. 
I'm not talking even about the backlash on stereotypes in advertising, which is a very real thing that has to be addressed. 
I'm saying it's bad business because you're leaving money on the table for your brands and your products. 
Because gender is such an easy thing to find in the market and to target and to talk about, it actually distracts you from the fun things that could be driving growth from your brands and, at the same time, it continues to create separation around genders and perpetuate stereotypes. 
So at the same time this activity is bad for your business and bad for society, so double whammy. 
And gender is one of those things like other demographics that have historically been good marketing shortcuts. 
At some point, however, we forgot that at the core we were targeting needs around cooking and cleaning and personal care and driving and sports and we just made it all a bucket and we said, "Men and women are different." 
We got used to it and we never challenged it again, and it's fascinating to me, and by fascinating I mean a little bit insane, that we still talk about this as a segment when it's most likely carryover bias. 
In fact, I don't come to this conclusion lightly. 
We have enough data to suggest that gender is not the best place to start for you to design and target your brands. 
And I would even go one step further: unless you are working in a very gender-specific product category, probably anything else you're hypothesizing about your consumer right now is going to be more useful than gender. 
We did not set up to draw this conclusion specifically. 
We found it. 
As consultants, our job is to go with our clients and understand their business and try to help them find spaces for their brands to grow. 
And it is our belief that if you want to find disruptive growth in the market, you have to go to the consumer and take a very agnostic view of the consumer. 
You have to go and look at them from scratch, remove yourself from biases and segments that you thought were important, just take a look to see where the growth is. 
And we built ourselves an algorithm precisely for that. 
So imagine that we have a person and we know a person is making a choice about a product or service, and from this person, I can know their gender, of course, other demographics, where they live, their income, other things. 
I know the context where this person is making a decision, where they are, who they're with, the energy, anything, and I can also put other things in the mix. 
I can know their attitudes, how they feel about the category, their behaviors. 
So if you imagine this kind of blob of big data about a person -- I'm going to oversimplify the science here but we basically built an algorithm for statistical tournaments. 
So a statistical tournament is like asking this big thing of data, "So, data, from everything you know about consumers at this point, what is the most useful thing I need to know that tells me more about what consumers need?" 
So the tournament is going to have winners and losers. 
The winners are those variables, those dimensions, that actually teach you a lot about your consumer, that if you know that, you know what they need. 
And there's losing variables that are just not that practical, and this matters because in a world of limited resources, you don't want to waste it on people that actually have the same needs. 
So why treat them differently? 
So at this point, I know, suspense is not killing you, because I told you what the output is, but what we found over time is after 200 projects around the world -- this is covering 20 countries or more -- in essence we ran about a hundred thousand of these tournaments, and, no surprise, gender was very rarely the most predictive thing to understand consumer needs. 
From a hundred thousand tournaments, gender only came out as the winning variable in about five percent of them. 
This is true around the world, by the way. 
We did this in places where traditional gender roles are a little more pronounced, and the conclusions were exactly the same. 
It was a little bit more important, gender, than five percent, but not material. 
So let's let that sink in for a second. 
No matter how you're looking at a consumer, most likely anything else is going to be more interesting to you than gender. 
There's probably something very important you need to know about them, and you're getting distracted because you're doing everything based on gender. 
And that's why I say you're leaving money on the table. 
Gender is easy. It's easy to design advertising based on gender, it's easy to target people online and on TV based on gender. 
But at the end, that's not where the exciting growth will come from. 
If you're a food company, for example, it's actually much more interesting to you to know where people are eating, who they are eating with, are they very nutritionally oriented. 
All of those things are actually significantly more powerful and useful than knowing if a person is a man or a woman. 
And that matters, of course, because then if you're putting your limited budget into action, then you're better off creating solutions for different occasions than trying to target women versus young men. 
Another example is alcoholic beverages. 
Thirty-five percent to 40 percent of consumption in alcoholic beverages around the world actually happens with women, but, you know, "women don't drink beer." 
Those are the things that we typically hear. 
But actually, when a man and a woman are, for the most part, in the same location, the emotional and functional needs they have at that moment are very similar. 
There's only one exception, by the way, and the exceptions exist, where if you have a man and a woman on a date, the man is trying to impress the woman and the woman is trying to connect with the man, so there's going to be a little bit of tension, but that's important to know. 
We'll take a few dates. 
Financial institutions: that's something where we've heard a lot about the difference between men and women, but actually talking about men and women as different is distracting you from the thing that is underneath. 
We made it so simple as "women don't like to invest," "women hate managing their money," "men are great and aggressive and risk-takers," but at the end it's not about men and women. 
It is actually a different narrative. 
It is about, there are people that are excited and energized and educated to manage their finances versus people that are not. 
So if you change the conversation from men and women to actually what's underneath then probably you'll stop being so condescending to women and you may start serving some men that are actually shy about managing their finances. 
I'll leave one more example. 
If I go back to the women that were playing sport at the beginning, one of the fascinating things we found over different countries, exploring sportswear, that if a person is a competitive person and they are in the moment of action, the needs are not different between a man and a woman. 
An athlete is an athlete. 
It doesn't matter for men and women, it doesn't matter for old and young, you are an athlete, and in the moment of action and extreme competition, you need this gear to work for you. 
So these soccer-playing women have a lot in common with their counterparts. 
Out of the field, it doesn't matter. 
Out of the field, they may be into fashion, into other things, but on the field, the needs are not different. 
So these are just a few examples on categories where we found that gender was not the best place to go, and actually the argument is that at this point it's not even a feminist push, it's just we got used to it. 
We got used to using gender, and it's important for us to start finding ways to measure other things about consumers so that we don't revert back to gender. 
I am not naïve, and I know there's still going to be appetite and certain ease around using gender, but at least this warrants a conversation. 
In your business, you have to inquire, is this really the best lens for me to grow. 
So, if you are, like me, a person that is in business, that I am constantly worried about what is my role in the broader societal discussions, if you're listening to your business and you hear things like, "Oh, my target are women, my target are men, this goes to young girls, young boys," when it's that gender conversation, unless you are working, again, in a very specific, gender-specific product category, take this as a warning sign, because if you keep having these conversations, you will keep perpetuating stereotypes of people and making people think that men and women are different. 
But because this is business, and we're running a business, and we want to grow it, at least kind of challenge your own instinct to use gender, because statistics say that you're probably not choosing the best variable to target your product or service. 
Growth is not easy at all. 
What makes you think that growth is going to come from going into market with such an outdated lens like gender? 
So let's stop doing what's easy and go for what's right. 
At this point, it's not just for your business, it's for society. 
Thank you. 
(Applause) 

Like many teachers, every year on the first day of school, I lead a sort of icebreaker activity with my students. 
I teach at Lincoln High School in Lincoln, Nebraska, and we are one of the oldest and most diverse high schools in our state. 
Also, to our knowledge, we're the only high school in the world whose mascot is the Links. 
Like, a chain. 
(Laughter) And with that being our mascot, we have a statue out front of our building of four links connected like a chain. 
And each link means something. 
Our links stand for tradition, excellence, unity and diversity. 
So on the first day of school, I teach my new ninth-graders about the meaning behind those links, and I give them each a slip of paper. 
On that paper, I ask them to write something about themselves. 
It can be something that they love, something that they hope for -- anything that describes their identity. 
And then I go around the room with a stapler, and I staple each of those slips together to make a chain. 
And we hang that chain up in our classroom as a decoration, sure, but also as a reminder that we are all connected. 
We are all links. 
So what happens when one of those links feels weak? 
And what happens when that weakness is in the person holding the stapler? 
The person who's supposed to make those connections. 
The teacher. 
As teachers, we work every day to provide support socially, emotionally and academically to our students who come to us with diverse and tough circumstances. 
Like most teachers, I have students who go home every day, and they sit around the kitchen table while one or both parents makes a healthy, well-rounded meal for them. 
They spend suppertime summarizing the story they read in ninth-grade English that day, or explaining how Newton's laws of motion work. 
But I also have students who go to the homeless shelter or to the group home. 
They go to the car that their family is sleeping in right now. 
They come to school with trauma, and when I go home every day, that goes home with me. 
And see, that's the hard part about teaching. 
It's not the grading, the lesson-planning, the meetings, though sure, those things do occupy a great deal of teachers' time and energy. 
The tough part about teaching is all the things you can't control for your kids, all the things you can't change for them once they walk out your door. 
And so I wonder if it's always been this way. 
I think back to my undergraduate training at the University of Georgia, where we were taught in our methods classes that the concept of good teaching has changed. 
We're not developing learners who are going to go out into a workforce where they'll stand on a line in a factory. 
Rather, we're sending our kids out into a workforce where they need to be able to communicate, collaborate and problem-solve. 
And that has caused teacher-student relationships to morph into something stronger than the giver of content and the receiver of knowledge. 
Lectures and sitting in silent rows just doesn't cut it anymore. 
We have to be able to build relationships with and among our students to help them feel connected in a world that depends on it. 
I think back to my second year teaching. 
I had a student who I'll call "David." 
And I remember feeling like I'd done a pretty good job at teaching that year: "Hey, I ain't no first-year teacher. 
I know what I'm doing." 
And it was on the last day of school, I told David to have a great summer. 
And I watched him walk down the hall, and I thought to myself, I don't even know what his voice sounds like. 
And that's when I realized I wasn't doing it right. 
So I changed almost everything about my teaching. 
I built in plenty of opportunities for my students to talk to me and to talk to each other, to share their writing and to verbalize their learning. 
And it was through those conversations I began not only to know their voice but to know their pain. 
I had David in class again that next year, and I learned that his father was undocumented and had been deported. 
He started acting out in school because all he wanted was for his family to be together again. 
In so many ways, I felt his pain. 
And I needed someone to listen, somebody to provide support for me so that I could support him in this thing that I could not even comprehend. 
And we recognize that need for police officers who've witnessed a gruesome crime scene and nurses who have lost a patient. 
But when it comes to teaching professionals, that urgency is lagging. 
I believe it's paramount that students and teachers, administrators, paraprofessionals and all other support staff have convenient and affordable access to mental wellness supports. 
When we are constantly serving others, often between 25 and 125 students each day, our emotional piggy banks are constantly being drawn upon. 
After a while, it can become so depleted, that we just can't bear it anymore. 
They call it "secondary trauma" and "compassion fatigue," the concept that we absorb the traumas our students share with us each day. 
And after a while, our souls become weighed down by the heaviness of it all. 
The Buffett Institute at the University of Nebraska recently found that most teachers -- 86 percent across early childhood settings -- experienced some depressive symptoms during the prior week. 
They found that approximately one in 10 reported clinically significant depressive symptoms. 
My interactions with colleagues and my own experiences make me feel like this is a universal struggle across all grade levels. 
So what are we missing? 
What are we allowing to break the chain and how do we repair it? 
In my career, I've experienced the death by suicide of two students and one amazing teacher who loved his kids; countless students experiencing homelessness; and kids entering and exiting the justice system. 
When these events happen, protocol is to say, "If you need someone to talk to, then ..." 
And I say that's not enough. 
I am so lucky. 
I work in an amazing school with great leadership. 
I serve a large district with so many healthy partnerships with community agencies. 
They have provided steadily increasing numbers of school counselors and therapists and support staff to help our students. 
They even provide staff members with access to free counseling as part of our employment plan. 
But many small districts and even some large ones simply cannot foot the bill without aid. 
(Exhales) Not only does every school need social and emotional support staff, trained professionals who can navigate the needs of the building -- not just the students, not just the teachers, but both -- we also need these trained professionals to intentionally seek out those closest to the trauma and check in with them. 
Many schools are doing what they can to fill in the gaps, starting with acknowledging that the work that we do is downright hard. 
Another school in Lincoln, Schoo Middle School, has what they call "Wellness Wednesdays." 
They invite in community yoga teachers, they sponsor walks around the neighborhood during lunch and organize social events that are all meant to bring people together. 
Zachary Elementary School in Zachary, Louisiana, has something they call a "Midweek Meetup," where they invite teachers to share lunch and to talk about the things that are going well and the things that are weighing heavy on their hearts. 
These schools are making space for conversations that matter. 
Finally, my friend and colleague Jen Highstreet takes five minutes out of each day to write an encouraging note to a colleague, letting them know that she sees their hard work and the heart that they share with others. 
She knows that those five minutes can have an invaluable and powerful ripple effect across our school. 
The chain that hangs in my classroom is more than just a decoration. 
Those links hang over our heads for the entire four years that our students walk our halls. 
And every year, I have seniors come back to my classroom, room 340, and they can still point out where their link hangs. 
They remember what they wrote on it. 
They feel connected and supported. 
And they have hope. 
Isn't that what we all need? 
Somebody to reach out and make sure that we're OK. 
To check in with us and remind us that we are a link. 
Every now and then, we all just need a little help holding the stapler. 
Thank you. 
(Applause) 

Shah Rukh Khan: Say no to plastic. 
The one thing that all environmental warriors teach us. 
But we begin and end the day with products that have been made from this virtually indestructible material. 
The truth is that our consumption and disposal of plastic has reached such unsustainable proportions that we need to address this using every idea and resource at hand. 
Please welcome someone who's helping solve India's waste management issues, Mani Vajipey, recycler and cofounder/CEO of Banyan Nation. 
(Applause) Mani Vajipey: If recycling were an Olympic sport, India would win the gold medal. 
India has one of the highest rates of plastic recycling and recovery in the entire world. 
Higher than the likes of Singapore, countries in North America and even countries in Europe. 
India recovers and recycles over 60 percent of its plastic waste, whereas a developed country, like United States, manages just about 10 percent. 
This high rate of collection is largely possible thanks to the millions of informal recyclers, the kabadiwalas, the bhandiwallas and the raddiwalas that we find at every street corner across every city in India. 
And yet, in spite of such a ubiquitous, extensive and intricate network of recyclers, India's national scenery is dominated by filth and squalor. 
And the general perception is that we don't recycle our plastics. 
The other thing about plastics in India is that any product made from recycled plastic is considered to be substandard and we expect it to be cheaper as well. 
What we don't realize is there are several types of plastics in their virgin and pure form, if recycled scientifically, can be recycled several times over without any compromise in quality. 
If we can recover and reuse our discarded plastic, then we save a significant amount of virgin plastic that we would have otherwise produced and consumed. 
And this is very important, because virgin plastic is made from fossil fuels that are an exhaustible resource. 
The more virgin plastic we produce and consume, the more plastic waste we have to manage. 
Mismanagement of plastic waste leads to the leakage of such materials into our water bodies. 
It's now common knowledge that by the year 2050 we'll have more plastics in our oceans than fish. 
About seven years ago, my friend and cofounder Raj and I, we decided that we were going to focus on solving this massive problem. 
We went around the city of Hyderabad, talking to local recyclers. 
Very soon, we found out that there were many recyclers just in Hyderabad alone. 
We soon realized that the plastic recycling industry of today is not very different from the milk industry of the '60s and '70s. 
Milk in India is produced by marginal milk farmers, with two or three cows or buffalos, who produce five to ten liters of milk a day. 
Instead of blindly aping solutions from the West, India championed the milk cooperative model, where thousands of such small-scale recyclers were brought together into groups. 
With scale came innovations and investments. 
India was transformed from a milk-deficit nation to the world's leading exporter and producer of milk. 
It dawned upon us that India had in the past solved much larger problems, like milk deficiency. 
We only need to look back to our past to find inspiration in solving what is perhaps the most fundamental issue of our times, that is plastic pollution. 
But before we could do this, or before brands could use recycled plastic, we had to solve two things. 
Quality and scale. 
For us, to make a shampoo bottle from discarded plastics, we had to collect tens of thousands of tons of discarded plastics. 
For that, we needed data. 
Raj and I built a simple data intelligence platform that allowed us to map all the recyclers, giving us a bird's eye view of every recycler in Hyderabad. 
The results were astounding. 
There were 2,000 kabadiwalas just in Hyderabad alone. 
That means, for every square kilometer, there were four kabadiwalas or informal recyclers. 
No developed country or city in the entire world has the luxury of such a brilliant collection system. 
(Applause) Once we had the data, the rest was fairly straightforward. 
We started trading with the informal recyclers, we started training them to segregate the materials based on our quality specifications. 
In the past five years, we've developed several clusters across South India, comprising of thousands of such informal recyclers, who interact with us both directly and digitally. 
In parallel, we began working on the problem of quality and purity of material. 
So in the past five years, we developed a proprietary cleaning technology that allows us to eliminate all contaminants. 
Today, Banyan's recycled granules have undergone stringent quality testing and have been certified by top global FMCG and automotive companies. 
In the next few months, tens of thousands of discarded plastics collected through informal recycler networks will be converted into high-quality granules and sent away to brands and large companies to make bottles for engine-oil packaging, for shampoo bottles and for lotions. 
In the next three years, we expect that over 500 million such bottles will be made from our recycled plastics. 
(Applause) But this is just the beginning. 
In the next five years, we aspire to build an India where 100 percent of discarded plastics are recycled and repurposed scientifically -- where plastic waste no longer threatens our water bodies, and the very survival of our terrestrial and marine life. 
So the next time you go to a store and pick up a shampoo bottle, see if that bottle uses safe and sustainable recycled plastic. 
That's not only just going to help the Earth but also reward the street corner recycler for his all-important work. 
Now that will compel brands to use more and more recycled plastic for their mainstream products and applications. 
Our tradition and our culture has a lot of ancient wisdom. 
Let's not destroy the only planet we have. 
The only home we have. 
Thank you. 
(Applause) SRK: Thank you, Mani. 
When I was young, I used to -- (sings in Hindi). 
How little do we know sometimes that we are, as a nation, the biggest recycler of plastics and waste, if not just plastic, and we didn't know this about our own country. 
MV: May I say something really cool? 
Cities like New York and Paris today are looking to put out reverse vending machines so that people can go and put trash in that and then they can get some cash. 
For the past several decades, the entire country and the kabadiwalas, and the bhandiwallas, we have been doing that. 
I'm very positive that in three to five years, you'll wake up, you know that the plastic is being recycled, you're going to pick up a packaging, you know that the package actually has a mark that uses recycled plastics, so I'm super optimistic about this. 
Even as an entrepreneur. 
(Applause) SRK: When I see a youngster do what he has done and achieved, I want that part to also be a source of encouragement for people to take over. 
So tell me, are you making a lot of money? 
MV: What's so brilliant about plastic recycling now is it's an idea whose time has come. 
And we're very fortunate to have signed a really big, multimillion-dollar contract with some of the top FMCG companies. 
So we are at the inflection point in India. 
And -- SRK: Tell us the money, money, money, Mani. 
MV: (Laughs) SRK: Give the figure, it will encourage people, it's not for greed, it's not for any of the reasons ... 
Say to them. 
They are making good money, yeah. 
(Applause) MV: For us, to build these systems in place, we need investors who will back us to develop -- (Laughter) (Applause) SRK: You have to be like Mani that I'm asking, "How much you're making?" 
he's already making it off me. 
But I may look stupid, but I'm not. 
I totally and completely believe in the concept of recycling plastic, and I'm going to help Mani with my first investment that all the plastic bottles that we have at shootings, in every shooting of mine, I'm going to send it to his company to recycle, starting from these four. 
Thank you very much, Mani. 
(Applause) MV: Thank you so much. 
SRK: Big round of applause for Mani. 
(Applause) 

Last year I showed these two slides so that demonstrate that the arctic ice cap, which for most of the last three million years has been the size of the lower 48 states, has shrunk by 40 percent. 
But this understates the seriousness of this particular problem because it doesn't show the thickness of the ice. 
The arctic ice cap is, in a sense, the beating heart of the global climate system. 
It expands in winter and contracts in summer. 
The next slide I show you will be a rapid fast-forward of what's happened over the last 25 years. 
The permanent ice is marked in red. 
As you see, it expands to the dark blue -- that's the annual ice in winter, and it contracts in summer. 
The so-called permanent ice, five years old or older, you can see is almost like blood, spilling out of the body here. 
In 25 years it's gone from this, to this. 
This is a problem because the warming heats up the frozen ground around the Arctic Ocean, where there is a massive amount of frozen carbon which, when it thaws, is turned into methane by microbes. 
Compared to the total amount of global warming pollution in the atmosphere, that amount could double if we cross this tipping point. 
Already in some shallow lakes in Alaska, methane is actively bubbling up out of the water. 
Professor Katey Walter from the University of Alaska went out with another team to another shallow lake last winter. 
Video: Whoa! (Laughter) Al Gore: She's okay. The question is whether we will be. 
And one reason is, this enormous heat sink heats up Greenland from the north. 
This is an annual melting river. 
But the volumes are much larger than ever. 
This is the Kangerlussuaq River in southwest Greenland. 
If you want to know how sea level rises from land-base ice melting this is where it reaches the sea. 
These flows are increasing very rapidly. 
At the other end of the planet, Antarctica the largest mass of ice on the planet. 
Last month scientists reported the entire continent is now in negative ice balance. 
And west Antarctica cropped up on top some under-sea islands, is particularly rapid in its melting. 
That's equal to 20 feet of sea level, as is Greenland. 
In the Himalayas, the third largest mass of ice: at the top you see new lakes, which a few years ago were glaciers. 
40 percent of all the people in the world get half of their drinking water from that melting flow. 
In the Andes, this glacier is the source of drinking water for this city. 
The flows have increased. 
But when they go away, so does much of the drinking water. 
In California there has been a 40 percent decline in the Sierra snowpack. 
This is hitting the reservoirs. 
And the predictions, as you've read, are serious. 
This drying around the world has lead to a dramatic increase in fires. 
And the disasters around the world have been increasing at an absolutely extraordinary and unprecedented rate. 
Four times as many in the last 30 years as in the previous 75. 
This is a completely unsustainable pattern. 
If you look at in the context of history you can see what this is doing. 
In the last five years we've added 70 million tons of CO2 every 24 hours -- 25 million tons every day to the oceans. 
Look carefully at the area of the eastern Pacific, from the Americas, extending westward, and on either side of the Indian subcontinent, where there is a radical depletion of oxygen in the oceans. 
The biggest single cause of global warming, along with deforestation, which is 20 percent of it, is the burning of fossil fuels. 
Oil is a problem, and coal is the most serious problem. 
The United States is one of the two largest emitters, along with China. 
And the proposal has been to build a lot more coal plants. 
But we're beginning to see a sea change. 
Here are the ones that have been cancelled in the last few years with some green alternatives proposed. 
(Applause) However there is a political battle in our country. 
And the coal industries and the oil industries spent a quarter of a billion dollars in the last calendar year promoting clean coal, which is an oxymoron. 
That image reminded me of something. 
(Laughter) Around Christmas, in my home in Tennessee, a billion gallons of coal sludge was spilled. 
You probably saw it on the news. 
This, all over the country, is the second largest waste stream in America. 
This happened around Christmas. 
One of the coal industry's ads around Christmas was this one. 
Video: ♪♫ Frosty the coal man is a jolly, happy soul. 
He's abundant here in America, and he helps our economy grow. 
Frosty the coal man is getting cleaner everyday. 
He's affordable and adorable, and workers keep their pay. 
Al Gore: This is the source of much of the coal in West Virginia. 
The largest mountaintop miner is the head of Massey Coal. 
Video: Don Blankenship: Let me be clear about it. Al Gore, Nancy Pelosi, Harry Reid, they don't know what they're talking about. 
Al Gore: So the Alliance for Climate Protection has launched two campaigns. 
This is one of them, part of one of them. 
Video: Actor: At COALergy we view climate change as a very serious threat to our business. 
That's why we've made it our primary goal to spend a large sum of money on an advertising effort to help bring out and complicate the truth about coal. 
The fact is, coal isn't dirty. 
We think it's clean -- smells good, too. 
So don't worry about climate change. 
Leave that up to us. 
(Laughter) Video: Actor: Clean coal -- you've heard a lot about it. 
So let's take a tour of this state-of-the-art clean coal facility. 
Amazing! The machinery is kind of loud. 
But that's the sound of clean coal technology. 
And while burning coal is one of the leading causes of global warming, the remarkable clean coal technology you see here changes everything. 
Take a good long look: this is today's clean coal technology. 
Al Gore: Finally, the positive alternative meshes with our economic challenge and our national security challenge. 
Video: Narrator: America is in crisis -- the economy, national security, the climate crisis. 
The thread that links them all: our addiction to carbon based fuels, like dirty coal and foreign oil. 
But now there is a bold new solution to get us out of this mess. 
Repower America with 100 percent clean electricity within 10 years. 
A plan to put America back to work, make us more secure, and help stop global warming. 
Finally, a solution that's big enough to solve our problems. 
Repower America. Find out more. 
Al Gore: This is the last one. 
Video: Narrator: It's about repowering America. 
One of the fastest ways to cut our dependence on old dirty fuels that are killing our planet. 
Man: Future's over here. Wind, sun, a new energy grid. 
Man #2: New investments to create high-paying jobs. 
Narrator: Repower America. It's time to get real. 
Al Gore: There is an old African proverb that says, "If you want to go quickly, go alone. 
If you want to go far, go together." 
We need to go far, quickly. 
Thank you very much. 
(Applause) 

By October 2018, Juan Carlos Rivera could no longer afford to live in his home in Copan, Honduras. 
As the "Dallas Morning News" reported, a gang was taking 10 percent of his earnings from his barber shop. 
His wife was assaulted going to her pre-K teaching job. 
And they were concerned about the safety of their young daughter. 
What could they do? 
Run away? 
Seek asylum in another country? 
They didn't want to do that. 
They just wanted to live in their country safely. 
But their options were limited. 
So that month, Juan Carlos moved his family to a safer location while he joined a group of migrants on the long and perilous journey from Central America to a job a family member said was open for him in the United States. 
By now we're all familiar with what awaited them at the US-Mexico border. 
The harsher and harsher penalties doled out to those crossing there. 
The criminal prosecutions for crossing illegally. 
The inhumane detention. 
And most terribly, separation of families. 
I'm here to tell you that not only is this treatment wrong, it's unnecessary. 
This belief that the only way to maintain order is with inhumane means is inaccurate. 
And in fact, the opposite is true. 
Only a humane system will create order at the border. 
When safe, orderly, legal travel to the United States is available, very few people choose travel that is unsafe, disorderly or illegal. 
Now, I appreciate the idea that legal immigration could just resolve the border crisis might sound a bit fanciful. 
But here is the good news: We have done this before. 
I've been working on immigration for years at the Cato Institute and other think tanks in Washington DC and as the senior policy adviser for a republican member of Congress, negotiating bipartisan immigration reform. 
And I've seen firsthand how America has implemented a system of humane order at the border for Mexico. 
It's called a guest worker program. 
And here's the even better news. 
We can replicate this success for Central America. 
Of course, some people will still need to seek asylum at the border. 
But to understand how successful this could be for immigrants like Juan Carlos, understand that until recently, nearly every immigrant arrested by Border Patrol was Mexican. 
In 1986, each Border Patrol agent arrested 510 Mexicans. 
Well over one per day. 
By 2019, this number was just eight. 
That's one every 43 days. 
It is a 98 percent reduction. 
So where have all the Mexicans gone? 
The most significant change is that the US began issuing hundreds of thousands of guest worker visas to Mexicans, so that they can come legally. 
José Vásquez Cabrera was among the first Mexican guest workers to take advantage of this visa expansion. 
He told "The New York Times" that before his visa he'd made terrifying illegal border crossings, braving near deadly heat and the treachery of the landscape. 
One time, a snake killed a member of his group. 
Thousands of other Mexicans also didn't make it, dying of dehydration in the deserts or drowning in the Rio Grande. 
Millions more were chased down and arrested. 
Guest worker visas have nearly ended this inhumane chaos. 
As Vásquez Cabrera put it, "I no longer have to risk my life to support my family. 
And when I'm here, I don't have to live in hiding." 
Guest worker visas actually reduced the number of illegal crossings more than the number of visas issued. 
Jose Bacilio, another Mexican guest worker, explained why to the "Washington Post" in April. 
He said, even though he hadn't received a visa this year, he wouldn't risk all of his future chances by crossing illegally. 
This likely helps explain why from 1996 to 2019 for every guest worker admitted legally from Mexico, there was a decline in two arrests of Mexicans crossing illegally. 
Now, it's true, Mexican guest workers do some really tough jobs. 
Picking fruit, cleaning crabs, landscaping in a 100-degree heat. 
And some critics maintain that guest worker visas are not actually humane and that the workers are just abused slaves. 
But Vásquez Cabrera thought a guest worker visa was liberating. 
Not enslavement. 
And he, like nearly all other guest workers, chose the legal path over the illegal one, repeatedly. 
The expansion of guest worker visas to Mexicans has been among the most significant humane changes in US immigration policy ever. 
And that humane change imposed order on chaos. 
So where does this leave Central Americans, like Juan Carlos? 
Well, Central Americans received just three percent of the guest worker visas issued in 2019, even as their share of border arrests has risen to 74 percent. 
The US issued just one guest worker visa to a Central American for every 78 who crossed the border illegally in 2019. 
So if they can't get their papers at home, many take their chances, coming up through Mexico to claim asylum at the border or cross illegally, even if, like Juan Carlos, they prefer to come to work. 
The US can do better. 
It needs to create new guest worker visas specifically for Central Americans. 
This would create an incentive for US businesses to seek out and hire Central Americans, paying for their flights to the United States, and diverting them from the illegal, dangerous trek north. 
Central Americans could build flourishing lives at home, without the need to seek asylum at the border or cross illegally, freeing up an overwhelmed system. 
Some people might say that letting the workers go back and forth will never work in Central America where violence is so high. 
But again, it worked in Mexico, even as Mexico's murder rate more than tripled over the last decade, to a level higher than much of Central America. 
And it would work for Juan Carlos, who said, despite the threats he only wants to live in the United States temporarily, to make enough money to sustain his family in their new home. 
He even suggested that a guest worker program would be one of the best things to help Hondurans like him. 
Cintia, a 29-year-old single mother of three from Honduras, seems to agree. 
She told the "Wall Street Journal" that she came for a job to support her kids and her mom. 
Surveys of Central Americans traveling through Mexico, by the College of the Northern Border in Mexico, confirm that Juan and Cintia are the norm. 
Most, not all, but most do come for jobs, even if, like the Riveras, they may also face some real threats at home. 
How much would a low-wage job help a Honduran, like Juan or Cintia? 
Hondurans like them make as much in one month in the United States as they do in an entire year working in Honduras. 
A few years' work in the United States can propel a Central American into its upper middle class where safety is easier to come by. 
What Central Americans lack is not the desire to work. 
Not the desire to contribute to the US economy, to contribute to the lives of Americans. 
What Central Americans lack is a legal alternative to asylum. 
To be able to do so legally. 
Of course, a new guest worker program will not resolve 100 percent of this complex phenomenon. 
Many asylum seekers will still need to seek safety at the US border. 
But with the flows reduced, we can more easily work out ways to deal with them humanely. 
But ultimately, no single policy has proven to do more to create an immigration system that is both humane and orderly than to let the workers come legally. 
Thank you. 
(Applause) 

I was thinking about my place in the universe, and about my first thought about what infinity might mean, when I was a child. 
And I thought that if time could reach forwards and backwards infinitely, doesn't that mean that every point in time is really infinitely small, and therefore somewhat meaningless. 
So we don't really have a place in the universe, as far as on a time line. 
But nothing else does either. 
Therefore every moment really is the most important moment that's ever happened, including this moment right now. 
And so therefore this music you're about to hear is maybe the most important music you'll ever hear in your life. 
(Laughter) (Applause) (Applause) Thank you. 
(Applause) (Applause) For those of you who I'll be fortunate enough to meet afterwards, you could please refrain from saying, "Oh my god, you're so much shorter in real life." 
(Laughter) Because it's like the stage is an optical illusion, for some reason. 
(Laughter) Somewhat like the curving of the universe. 
I don't know what it is. I get asked in interviews a lot, "My god, you're guitars are so gigantic!" 
(Laughter) "You must get them custom made -- special, humongous guitars." 
(Laughter) (Applause) Thank you very much. 
(Applause) 

Why do so many people reach success and then fail? 
One of the big reasons is, we think success is a one-way street. 
So we do everything that leads up to success, but then we get there. We figure we've made it, we sit back in our comfort zone, and we actually stop doing everything that made us successful. 
And it doesn't take long to go downhill. 
And I can tell you this happens, because it happened to me. 
Reaching success, I worked hard, I pushed myself. 
But then I stopped, because I figured, "Oh, you know, I made it. 
I can just sit back and relax." 
Reaching success, I always tried to improve and do good work. 
But then I stopped because I figured, "Hey, I'm good enough. 
I don't need to improve any more." 
Reaching success, I was pretty good at coming up with good ideas. 
Because I did all these simple things that led to ideas. 
But then I stopped, because I figured I was this hot-shot guy and I shouldn't have to work at ideas, they should just come like magic. 
And the only thing that came was creative block. 
I couldn't come up with any ideas. 
Reaching success, I always focused on clients and projects, and ignored the money. Then all this money started pouring in. 
And I got distracted by it. 
And suddenly I was on the phone to my stockbroker and my real estate agent, when I should have been talking to my clients. 
And reaching success, I always did what I loved. 
But then I got into stuff that I didn't love, like management. I am the world's worst manager, but I figured I should be doing it, because I was, after all, the president of the company. 
Well, soon a black cloud formed over my head and here I was, outwardly very successful, but inwardly very depressed. 
But I'm a guy; I knew how to fix it. 
I bought a fast car. 
(Laughter) It didn't help. 
I was faster but just as depressed. 
So I went to my doctor. I said, "Doc, I can buy anything I want. But I'm not happy. I'm depressed. 
It's true what they say, and I didn't believe it until it happened to me. 
But money can't buy happiness." 
He said, "No. But it can buy Prozac." 
And he put me on anti-depressants. 
And yeah, the black cloud faded a little bit, but so did all the work, because I was just floating along. I couldn't care less if clients ever called. 
(Laughter) And clients didn't call. 
(Laughter) Because they could see I was no longer serving them, I was only serving myself. 
So they took their money and their projects to others who would serve them better. 
Well, it didn't take long for business to drop like a rock. 
My partner and I, Thom, we had to let all our employees go. 
It was down to just the two of us, and we were about to go under. 
And that was great. 
Because with no employees, there was nobody for me to manage. 
So I went back to doing the projects I loved. 
I had fun again, I worked harder and, to cut a long story short, did all the things that took me back up to success. 
But it wasn't a quick trip. 
It took seven years. 
But in the end, business grew bigger than ever. 
And when I went back to following these eight principles, the black cloud over my head disappeared altogether. 
And I woke up one day and I said, "I don't need Prozac anymore." 
And I threw it away and haven't needed it since. 
I learned that success isn't a one-way street. 
It doesn't look like this; it really looks more like this. 
It's a continuous journey. 
And if we want to avoid "success-to-failure-syndrome," we just keep following these eight principles, because that is not only how we achieve success, it's how we sustain it. 
So here is to your continued success. 
Thank you very much. 
(Applause) 

A new drug reduces the risk of heart attacks by 40%. 
Shark attacks are up by a factor of two. 
Drinking a liter of soda per day doubles your chance of developing cancer. 
These are all examples of relative risk, a common way risk is presented in news articles. 
Risk evaluation is a complicated tangle of statistical thinking and personal preference. 
One common stumbling block is the difference between relative risks like these and what are called absolute risks. 
Risk is the likelihood that an event will occur. 
It can be expressed as either a percentage— for example, that heart attacks occur in 11% of men between the ages of 60 and 79— or as a rate— that one in two million divers along Australia’s western coast will suffer a fatal shark bite each year. 
These numbers express the absolute risk of heart attacks and shark attacks in these groups. 
Changes in risk can be expressed in relative or absolute terms. 
For example, a review in 2009 found that mammography screenings reduced the number of breast cancer deaths from five women in one thousand to four. 
The absolute risk reduction was about .1%. 
But the relative risk reduction from 5 cases of cancer mortality to four is 20%. 
Based on reports of this higher number, people overestimated the impact of screening. 
To see why the difference between the two ways of expressing risk matters, let’s consider the hypothetical example of a drug that reduces heart attack risk by 40%. 
Imagine that out of a group of 1,000 people who didn’t take the new drug, 10 would have heart attacks. 
The absolute risk is 10 out of 1,000, or 1%. 
If a similar group of 1,000 people did take the drug, the number of heart attacks would be six. 
In other words, the drug could prevent four out of ten heart attacks— a relative risk reduction of 40%. 
Meanwhile, the absolute risk only dropped from 1% to 0.6%— but the 40% relative risk decrease sounds a lot more significant. 
Surely preventing even a handful of heart attacks, or any other negative outcome, is worthwhile— isn’t it? 
Not necessarily. 
The problem is that choices that reduce some risks can put you in the path of others. 
Suppose the heart-attack drug caused cancer in one half of 1% of patients. 
In our group of 1,000 people, four heart attacks would be prevented by taking the drug, but there would be five new cases of cancer. 
The relative reduction in heart attack risk sounds substantial and the absolute risk of cancer sounds small, but they work out to about the same number of cases. 
In real life, everyone’s individual evaluation of risk will vary depending on their personal circumstances. 
If you know you have a family history of heart disease you might be more strongly motivated to take a medication that would lower your heart-attack risk, even knowing it provided only a small reduction in absolute risk. 
Sometimes, we have to decide between exposing ourselves to risks that aren’t directly comparable. 
If, for example, the heart attack drug carried a higher risk of a debilitating, but not life-threatening, side effect like migraines rather than cancer, our evaluation of whether that risk is worth taking might change. 
And sometimes there isn’t necessarily a correct choice: some might say even a minuscule risk of shark attack is worth avoiding, because all you’d miss out on is an ocean swim, while others wouldn’t even consider skipping a swim to avoid an objectively tiny risk of shark attack. 
For all these reasons, risk evaluation is tricky at baseline, and reporting on risk can be misleading, especially when it shares some numbers in absolute terms and others in relative terms. 
Understanding how these measures work will help you cut through some of the confusion and better evaluate risk. 

A human child is born, and for quite a long time is a consumer. 
It cannot be consciously a contributor. 
It is helpless. 
It doesn't know how to survive, even though it is endowed with an instinct to survive. 
It needs the help of mother, or a foster mother, to survive. 
It can't afford to doubt the person who tends the child. 
It has to totally surrender, as one surrenders to an anesthesiologist. 
It has to totally surrender. 
That implies a lot of trust. 
That implies the trusted person won't violate the trust. 
As the child grows, it begins to discover that the person trusted is violating the trust. 
It doesn't know even the word "violation." 
Therefore, it has to blame itself, a wordless blame, which is more difficult to really resolve -- the wordless self-blame. 
As the child grows to become an adult: so far, it has been a consumer, but the growth of a human being lies in his or her capacity to contribute, to be a contributor. 
One cannot contribute unless one feels secure, one feels big, one feels: I have enough. 
To be compassionate is not a joke. 
It's not that simple. 
One has to discover a certain bigness in oneself. 
That bigness should be centered on oneself, not in terms of money, not in terms of power you wield, not in terms of any status that you can command in the society, but it should be centered on oneself. 
The self: you are self-aware. 
On that self, it should be centered -- a bigness, a wholeness. 
Otherwise, compassion is just a word and a dream. 
You can be compassionate occasionally, more moved by empathy than by compassion. 
Thank God we are empathetic. 
When somebody's in pain, we pick up the pain. 
In a Wimbledon final match, these two guys fight it out. 
Each one has got two games. 
It can be anybody's game. 
What they have sweated so far has no meaning. 
One person wins. 
The tennis etiquette is, both the players have to come to the net and shake hands. 
The winner boxes the air and kisses the ground, throws his shirt as though somebody is waiting for it. 
(Laughter) And this guy has to come to the net. 
When he comes to the net, you see, his whole face changes. 
It looks as though he's wishing that he didn't win. 
Why? Empathy. 
That's human heart. 
No human heart is denied of that empathy. 
No religion can demolish that by indoctrination. 
No culture, no nation and nationalism -- nothing can touch it because it is empathy. 
And that capacity to empathize is the window through which you reach out to people, you do something that makes a difference in somebody's life -- even words, even time. 
Compassion is not defined in one form. 
There's no Indian compassion. 
There's no American compassion. 
It transcends nation, the gender, the age. 
Why? Because it is there in everybody. 
It's experienced by people occasionally. 
Then this occasional compassion, we are not talking about -- it will never remain occasional. 
By mandate, you cannot make a person compassionate. 
You can't say, "Please love me." 
Love is something you discover. 
It's not an action, but in the English language, it is also an action. 
I will come to it later. 
So one has got to discover a certain wholeness. 
I am going to cite the possibility of being whole, which is within our experience, everybody's experience. 
In spite of a very tragic life, one is happy in moments which are very few and far between. 
And the one who is happy, even for a slapstick joke, accepts himself and also the scheme of things in which one finds oneself. 
That means the whole universe, known things and unknown things. 
All of them are totally accepted because you discover your wholeness in yourself. 
The subject -- "me" -- and the object -- the scheme of things -- fuse into oneness, an experience nobody can say, "I am denied of," an experience common to all and sundry. 
That experience confirms that, in spite of all your limitations -- all your wants, desires, unfulfilled, and the credit cards and layoffs and, finally, baldness -- you can be happy. 
But the extension of the logic is that you don't need to fulfill your desire to be happy. 
You are the very happiness, the wholeness that you want to be. 
There's no choice in this: that only confirms the reality that the wholeness cannot be different from you, cannot be minus you. 
It has got to be you. 
You cannot be a part of wholeness and still be whole. 
Your moment of happiness reveals that reality, that realization, that recognition: "Maybe I am the whole. 
Maybe the swami is right. 
Maybe the swami is right." You start your new life. 
Then everything becomes meaningful. 
I have no more reason to blame myself. 
If one has to blame oneself, one has a million reasons plus many. 
But if I say, in spite of my body being limited -- if it is black it is not white, if it is white it is not black: body is limited any which way you look at it. Limited. 
Your knowledge is limited, health is limited, and power is therefore limited, and the cheerfulness is going to be limited. 
Compassion is going to be limited. 
Everything is going to be limitless. 
You cannot command compassion unless you become limitless, and nobody can become limitless, either you are or you are not. Period. 
And there is no way of your being not limitless too. 
Your own experience reveals, in spite of all limitations, you are the whole. 
And the wholeness is the reality of you when you relate to the world. 
It is love first. 
When you relate to the world, the dynamic manifestation of the wholeness is, what we say, love. 
And itself becomes compassion if the object that you relate to evokes that emotion. 
Then that again transforms into giving, into sharing. 
You express yourself because you have compassion. 
To discover compassion, you need to be compassionate. 
To discover the capacity to give and share, you need to be giving and sharing. 
There is no shortcut: it is like swimming by swimming. 
You learn swimming by swimming. 
You cannot learn swimming on a foam mattress and enter into water. 
(Laughter) You learn swimming by swimming. You learn cycling by cycling. 
You learn cooking by cooking, having some sympathetic people around you to eat what you cook. 
(Laughter) And, therefore, what I say, you have to fake it and make it. 
(Laughter) You need to. 
My predecessor meant that. 
You have to act it out. 
You have to act compassionately. 
There is no verb for compassion, but you have an adverb for compassion. 
That's interesting to me. 
You act compassionately. 
But then, how to act compassionately if you don't have compassion? 
That is where you fake. 
You fake it and make it. This is the mantra of the United States of America. 
(Laughter) You fake it and make it. 
You act compassionately as though you have compassion: grind your teeth, take all the support system. 
If you know how to pray, pray. 
Ask for compassion. 
Let me act compassionately. 
Do it. 
You'll discover compassion and also slowly a relative compassion, and slowly, perhaps if you get the right teaching, you'll discover compassion is a dynamic manifestation of the reality of yourself, which is oneness, wholeness, and that's what you are. 
With these words, thank you very much. 
(Applause) 

We grew up interacting with the physical objects around us. 
There are an enormous number of them that we use every day. 
Unlike most of our computing devices, these objects are much more fun to use. 
When you talk about objects, one other thing automatically comes attached to that thing, and that is gestures: how we manipulate these objects, how we use these objects in everyday life. 
We use gestures not only to interact with these objects, but we also use them to interact with each other. 
A gesture of "Namaste!", maybe, to respect someone, or maybe, in India I don't need to teach a kid that this means "four runs" in cricket. 
It comes as a part of our everyday learning. 
So, I am very interested, from the beginning, how our knowledge about everyday objects and gestures, and how we use these objects, can be leveraged to our interactions with the digital world. 
Rather than using a keyboard and mouse, why can I not use my computer in the same way that I interact in the physical world? 
So, I started this exploration around eight years back, and it literally started with a mouse on my desk. 
Rather than using it for my computer, I actually opened it. 
Most of you might be aware that, in those days, the mouse used to come with a ball inside, and there were two rollers that actually guide the computer where the ball is moving, and, accordingly, where the mouse is moving. 
So, I was interested in these two rollers, and I actually wanted more, so I borrowed another mouse from a friend -- never returned to him -- and I now had four rollers. 
Interestingly, what I did with these rollers is, basically, I took them off of these mouses and then put them in one line. 
It had some strings and pulleys and some springs. 
What I got is basically a gesture-interface device that actually acts as a motion-sensing device made for two dollars. 
So, here, whatever movement I do in my physical world is actually replicated inside the digital world just using this small device that I made, around eight years back, in 2000. 
Because I was interested in integrating these two worlds, I thought of sticky notes. 
I thought, "Why can I not connect the normal interface of a physical sticky note to the digital world?" 
A message written on a sticky note to my mom, on paper, can come to an SMS, or maybe a meeting reminder automatically syncs with my digital calendar -- a to-do list that automatically syncs with you. 
But you can also search in the digital world, or maybe you can write a query, saying, "What is Dr. Smith's address?" 
and this small system actually prints it out -- so it actually acts like a paper input-output system, just made out of paper. 
In another exploration, I thought of making a pen that can draw in three dimensions. 
So, I implemented this pen that can help designers and architects not only think in three dimensions, but they can actually draw, so that it's more intuitive to use that way. 
Then I thought, "Why not make a Google Map, but in the physical world?" 
Rather than typing a keyword to find something, I put my objects on top of it. 
If I put a boarding pass, it will show me where the flight gate is. 
A coffee cup will show where you can find more coffee, or where you can trash the cup. 
So, these were some of the earlier explorations I did because the goal was to connect these two worlds seamlessly. 
Among all these experiments, there was one thing in common: I was trying to bring a part of the physical world to the digital world. 
I was taking some part of the objects, or any of the intuitiveness of real life, and bringing them to the digital world, because the goal was to make our computing interfaces more intuitive. 
But then I realized that we humans are not actually interested in computing. 
What we are interested in is information. 
We want to know about things. 
We want to know about dynamic things going around. 
So I thought, around last year -- in the beginning of the last year -- I started thinking, "Why can I not take this approach in the reverse way?" 
Maybe, "How about I take my digital world and paint the physical world with that digital information?" 
Because pixels are actually, right now, confined in these rectangular devices that fit in our pockets. 
Why can I not remove this confine and take that to my everyday objects, everyday life so that I don't need to learn the new language for interacting with those pixels? 
So, in order to realize this dream, I actually thought of putting a big-size projector on my head. 
I think that's why this is called a head-mounted projector, isn't it? 
I took it very literally, and took my bike helmet, put a little cut over there so that the projector actually fits nicely. 
So now, what I can do -- I can augment the world around me with this digital information. 
But later, I realized that I actually wanted to interact with those digital pixels, also. 
So I put a small camera over there that acts as a digital eye. 
Later, we moved to a much better, consumer-oriented pendant version of that, that many of you now know as the SixthSense device. 
But the most interesting thing about this particular technology is that you can carry your digital world with you wherever you go. 
You can start using any surface, any wall around you, as an interface. 
The camera is actually tracking all your gestures. 
Whatever you're doing with your hands, it's understanding that gesture. 
And, actually, if you see, there are some color markers that in the beginning version we are using with it. 
You can start painting on any wall. 
You stop by a wall, and start painting on that wall. 
But we are not only tracking one finger, here. 
We are giving you the freedom of using all of both of your hands, so you can actually use both of your hands to zoom into or zoom out of a map just by pinching all present. 
The camera is actually doing -- just, getting all the images -- is doing the edge recognition and also the color recognition and so many other small algorithms are going on inside. 
So, technically, it's a little bit complex, but it gives you an output which is more intuitive to use, in some sense. 
But I'm more excited that you can actually take it outside. 
Rather than getting your camera out of your pocket, you can just do the gesture of taking a photo, and it takes a photo for you. 
(Applause) Thank you. 
And later I can find a wall, anywhere, and start browsing those photos or maybe, "OK, I want to modify this photo a little bit and send it as an email to a friend." 
So, we are looking for an era where computing will actually merge with the physical world. 
And, of course, if you don't have any surface, you can start using your palm for simple operations. 
Here, I'm dialing a phone number just using my hand. 
The camera is actually not only understanding your hand movements, but, interestingly, is also able to understand what objects you are holding in your hand. 
For example, in this case, the book cover is matched with so many thousands, or maybe millions of books online, and checking out which book it is. 
Once it has that information, it finds out more reviews about that, or maybe New York Times has a sound overview on that, so you can actually hear, on a physical book, a review as sound. 
(Video) Famous talk at Harvard University -- This was Obama's visit last week to MIT. 
(Video) And particularly I want to thank two outstanding MIT -- Pranav Mistry: So, I was seeing the live [video] of his talk, outside, on just a newspaper. 
Your newspaper will show you live weather information rather than having it updated. 
You have to check your computer in order to do that, right? 
(Applause) When I'm going back, I can just use my boarding pass to check how much my flight has been delayed, because at that particular time, I'm not feeling like opening my iPhone, and checking out a particular icon. 
And I think this technology will not only change the way -- (Laughter) Yes. 
It will change the way we interact with people, also, not only the physical world. 
The fun part is, I'm going to the Boston metro, and playing a pong game inside the train on the ground, right? 
(Laughter) And I think the imagination is the only limit of what you can think of when this kind of technology merges with real life. 
But many of you argue, actually, that all of our work is not only about physical objects. 
We actually do lots of accounting and paper editing and all those kinds of things; what about that? 
And many of you are excited about the next-generation tablet computers to come out in the market. 
So, rather than waiting for that, I actually made my own, just using a piece of paper. 
So, what I did here is remove the camera -- All the webcam cameras have a microphone inside the camera. 
I removed the microphone from that, and then just pinched that -- like I just made a clip out of the microphone -- and clipped that to a piece of paper, any paper that you found around. 
So now the sound of the touch is getting me when exactly I'm touching the paper. 
But the camera is actually tracking where my fingers are moving. 
You can of course watch movies. 
(Video) Good afternoon. My name is Russell, and I am a Wilderness Explorer in Tribe 54." 
PM: And you can of course play games. 
(Car engine) Here, the camera is actually understanding how you're holding the paper and playing a car-racing game. 
(Applause) Many of you already must have thought, OK, you can browse. 
Yeah. Of course you can browse to any websites or you can do all sorts of computing on a piece of paper wherever you need it. 
So, more interestingly, I'm interested in how we can take that in a more dynamic way. 
When I come back to my desk, I can just pinch that information back to my desktop so I can use my full-size computer. 
(Applause) And why only computers? We can just play with papers. 
Paper world is interesting to play with. 
Here, I'm taking a part of a document, and putting over here a second part from a second place, and I'm actually modifying the information that I have over there. 
Yeah. And I say, "OK, this looks nice, let me print it out, that thing." 
So I now have a print-out of that thing. 
So the workflow is more intuitive, the way we used to do it maybe 20 years back, rather than now switching between these two worlds. 
So, as a last thought, I think that integrating information to everyday objects will not only help us to get rid of the digital divide, the gap between these two worlds, but will also help us, in some way, to stay human, to be more connected to our physical world. 
And it will actually help us not end up being machines sitting in front of other machines. 
That's all. Thank you. 
(Applause) Thank you. 
(Applause) Chris Anderson: So, Pranav, first of all, you're a genius. 
This is incredible, really. 
What are you doing with this? Is there a company being planned? 
Or is this research forever, or what? 
Pranav Mistry: So, there are lots of companies, sponsor companies of Media Lab interested in taking this ahead in one or another way. 
Companies like mobile-phone operators want to take this in a different way than the NGOs in India, thinking, "Why can we only have 'Sixth Sense'? 
We should have a 'Fifth Sense' for missing-sense people who cannot speak. 
This technology can be used for them to speak out in a different way maybe a speaker system." 
CA: What are your own plans? Are you staying at MIT, or are you going to do something with this? 
PM: I'm trying to make this more available to people so that anyone can develop their own SixthSense device, because the hardware is actually not that hard to manufacture or hard to make your own. 
We will provide all the open source software for them, maybe starting next month. 
CA: Open source? Wow. 
(Applause) CA: Are you going to come back to India with some of this, at some point? 
PM: Yeah. Yes, yes, of course. 
CA: What are your plans? MIT? India? 
How are you going to split your time going forward? 
PM: There is a lot of energy here. Lots of learning. 
All of this work that you have seen is all about my learning in India. 
And now, if you see, it's more about the cost-effectiveness: this system costs you $300 compared to the $20,000 surface tables, or anything like that. 
Or maybe even the $2 mouse gesture system at that time was costing around $5,000? 
I showed that, at a conference, to President Abdul Kalam, at that time, and then he said, "OK, we should use this in Bhabha Atomic Research Centre for some use of that." 
So I'm excited about how I can bring the technology to the masses rather than just keeping that technology in the lab environment. 
(Applause) CA: Based on the people we've seen at TED, I would say you're truly one of the two or three best inventors in the world right now. 
It's an honor to have you at TED. 
Thank you so much. 
That's fantastic. 
(Applause) 

To understand the business of mythology and what a Chief Belief Officer is supposed to do, you have to hear a story of Ganesha, the elephant-headed god who is the scribe of storytellers, and his brother, the athletic warlord of the gods, Kartikeya. 
The two brothers one day decided to go on a race, three times around the world. 
Kartikeya leapt on his peacock and flew around the continents and the mountains and the oceans. 
He went around once, he went around twice, he went around thrice. 
But his brother, Ganesha, simply walked around his parents once, twice, thrice, and said, "I won." 
"How come?" said Kartikeya. 
And Ganesha said, "You went around 'the world.' I went around 'my world.'" What matters more? 
If you understand the difference between 'the world' and 'my world,' you understand the difference between logos and mythos. 
'The world' is objective, logical, universal, factual, scientific. 
'My world' is subjective. 
It's emotional. It's personal. 
It's perceptions, thoughts, feelings, dreams. 
It is the belief system that we carry. 
It's the myth that we live in. 
'The world' tells us how the world functions, how the sun rises, how we are born. 
'My world' tells us why the sun rises, why we were born. 
Every culture is trying to understand itself: "Why do we exist?" 
And every culture comes up with its own understanding of life, its own customized version of mythology. 
Culture is a reaction to nature, and this understanding of our ancestors is transmitted generation from generation in the form of stories, symbols and rituals, which are always indifferent to rationality. 
And so, when you study it, you realize that different people of the world have a different understanding of the world. 
Different people see things differently -- different viewpoints. 
There is my world and there is your world, and my world is always better than your world, because my world, you see, is rational and yours is superstition. 
Yours is faith. 
Yours is illogical. 
This is the root of the clash of civilizations. 
It took place, once, in 326 B.C. 
on the banks of a river called the Indus, now in Pakistan. 
This river lends itself to India's name. 
India. Indus. 
Alexander, a young Macedonian, met there what he called a "gymnosophist," which means "the naked, wise man." 
We don't know who he was. 
Perhaps he was a Jain monk, like Bahubali over here, the Gomateshwara Bahubali whose image is not far from Mysore. 
Or perhaps he was just a yogi who was sitting on a rock, staring at the sky and the sun and the moon. 
Alexander asked, "What are you doing?" 
and the gymnosophist answered, "I'm experiencing nothingness." 
Then the gymnosophist asked, "What are you doing?" 
and Alexander said, "I am conquering the world." 
And they both laughed. 
Each one thought that the other was a fool. 
The gymnosophist said, "Why is he conquering the world? 
It's pointless." 
And Alexander thought, "Why is he sitting around, doing nothing? 
What a waste of a life." 
To understand this difference in viewpoints, we have to understand the subjective truth of Alexander -- his myth, and the mythology that constructed it. 
Alexander's mother, his parents, his teacher Aristotle told him the story of Homer's "Iliad." 
They told him of a great hero called Achilles, who, when he participated in battle, victory was assured, but when he withdrew from the battle, defeat was inevitable. 
"Achilles was a man who could shape history, a man of destiny, and this is what you should be, Alexander." 
That's what he heard. 
"What should you not be? 
You should not be Sisyphus, who rolls a rock up a mountain all day only to find the boulder rolled down at night. 
Don't live a life which is monotonous, mediocre, meaningless. 
Be spectacular! -- like the Greek heroes, like Jason, who went across the sea with the Argonauts and fetched the Golden Fleece. 
Be spectacular like Theseus, who entered the labyrinth and killed the bull-headed Minotaur. 
When you play in a race, win! -- because when you win, the exhilaration of victory is the closest you will come to the ambrosia of the gods." 
Because, you see, the Greeks believed you live only once, and when you die, you have to cross the River Styx. 
And if you have lived an extraordinary life, you will be welcomed to Elysium, or what the French call "Champs-Élysées" -- (Laughter) -- the heaven of the heroes. 
But these are not the stories that the gymnosophist heard. 
He heard a very different story. 
He heard of a man called Bharat, after whom India is called Bhārata. 
Bharat also conquered the world. 
And then he went to the top-most peak of the greatest mountain of the center of the world called Meru. 
And he wanted to hoist his flag to say, "I was here first." 
But when he reached the mountain peak, he found the peak covered with countless flags of world-conquerors before him, each one claiming "'I was here first' ... 
that's what I thought until I came here." 
And suddenly, in this canvas of infinity, Bharat felt insignificant. 
This was the mythology of the gymnosophist. 
You see, he had heroes, like Ram -- Raghupati Ram and Krishna, Govinda Hari. 
But they were not two characters on two different adventures. 
They were two lifetimes of the same hero. 
When the Ramayana ends the Mahabharata begins. 
When Ram dies, Krishna is born. 
When Krishna dies, eventually he will be back as Ram. 
You see, the Indians also had a river that separates the land of the living from the land of the dead. 
But you don't cross it once. 
You go to and fro endlessly. 
It was called the Vaitarani. 
You go again and again and again. 
Because, you see, nothing lasts forever in India, not even death. 
And so, you have these grand rituals where great images of mother goddesses are built and worshiped for 10 days ... 
And what do you do at the end of 10 days? 
You dunk it in the river. 
Because it has to end. 
And next year, she will come back. 
What goes around always comes around, and this rule applies not just to man, but also the gods. 
You see, the gods have to come back again and again and again as Ram, as Krishna. 
Not only do they live infinite lives, but the same life is lived infinite times till you get to the point of it all. 
"Groundhog Day." 
(Laughter) Two different mythologies. 
Which is right? 
Two different mythologies, two different ways of looking at the world. 
One linear, one cyclical. 
One believes this is the one and only life. 
The other believes this is one of many lives. 
And so, the denominator of Alexander's life was one. 
So, the value of his life was the sum total of his achievements. 
The denominator of the gymnosophist's life was infinity. 
So, no matter what he did, it was always zero. 
And I believe it is this mythological paradigm that inspired Indian mathematicians to discover the number zero. 
Who knows? 
And that brings us to the mythology of business. 
If Alexander's belief influenced his behavior, if the gymnosophist's belief influences his behavior, then it was bound to influence the business they were in. 
You see, what is business but the result of how the market behaves and how the organization behaves? 
And if you look at cultures around the world, all you have to do is understand the mythology and you will see how they behave and how they do business. 
Take a look. 
If you live only once, in one-life cultures around the world, you will see an obsession with binary logic, absolute truth, standardization, absoluteness, linear patterns in design. 
But if you look at cultures which have cyclical and based on infinite lives, you will see a comfort with fuzzy logic, with opinion, with contextual thinking, with everything is relative, sort of -- (Laughter) mostly. 
(Laughter) You look at art. Look at the ballerina, how linear she is in her performance. 
And then look at the Indian classical dancer, the Kuchipudi dancer, the Bharatanatyam dancer, curvaceous. 
(Laughter) And then look at business. 
Standard business model: vision, mission, values, processes. 
Sounds very much like the journey through the wilderness to the promised land, with the commandments held by the leader. 
And if you comply, you will go to heaven. 
But in India there is no "the" promised land. 
There are many promised lands, depending on your station in society, depending on your stage of life. 
You see, businesses are not run as institutions, by the idiosyncrasies of individuals. 
It's always about taste. 
It's always about my taste. 
You see, Indian music, for example, does not have the concept of harmony. 
There is no orchestra conductor. 
There is one performer standing there, and everybody follows. 
And you can never replicate that performance twice. 
It is not about documentation and contract. 
It's about conversation and faith. 
It's not about compliance. It's about setting, getting the job done, by bending or breaking the rules -- just look at your Indian people around here, you'll see them smile; they know what it is. 
(Laughter) And then look at people who have done business in India, you'll see the exasperation on their faces. 
(Laughter) (Applause) You see, this is what India is today. The ground reality is based on a cyclical world view. 
So, it's rapidly changing, highly diverse, chaotic, ambiguous, unpredictable. 
And people are okay with it. 
And then globalization is taking place. 
The demands of modern institutional thinking is coming in. 
Which is rooted in one-life culture. 
And a clash is going to take place, like on the banks of the Indus. 
It is bound to happen. 
I have personally experienced it. I'm trained as a medical doctor. 
I did not want to study surgery. Don't ask me why. 
I love mythology too much. 
I wanted to learn mythology. But there is nowhere you can study. 
So, I had to teach it to myself. 
And mythology does not pay, well, until now. 
(Laughter) So, I had to take up a job. And I worked in the pharma industry. 
And I worked in the healthcare industry. 
And I worked as a marketing guy, and a sales guy, and a knowledge guy, and a content guy, and a training guy. 
I even was a business consultant, doing strategies and tactics. 
And I would see the exasperation between my American and European colleagues, when they were dealing with India. 
Example: Please tell us the process to invoice hospitals. 
Step A. Step B. Step C. Mostly. 
(Laughter) How do you parameterize "mostly"? 
How do you put it in a nice little software? You can't. 
I would give my viewpoints to people. 
But nobody was interested in listening to it, you see, until I met Kishore Biyani of the Future group. 
You see, he has established the largest retail chain, called Big Bazaar. 
And there are more than 200 formats, across 50 cities and towns of India. 
And he was dealing with diverse and dynamic markets. 
And he knew very intuitively, that best practices, developed in Japan and China and Europe and America will not work in India. 
He knew that institutional thinking doesn't work in India. Individual thinking does. 
He had an intuitive understanding of the mythic structure of India. 
So, he had asked me to be the Chief Belief Officer, and said, "All I want to do is align belief." 
Sounds so simple. 
But belief is not measurable. 
You can't measure it. You can't manage it. 
So, how do you construct belief? 
How do you enhance the sensitivity of people to Indian-ness. 
Even if you are Indian, it is not very explicit, it is not very obvious. 
So, I tried to work on the standard model of culture, which is, develop stories, symbols and rituals. 
And I will share one of the rituals with you. 
You see it is based on the Hindu ritual of Darshan. 
Hindus don't have the concept of commandments. 
So, there is nothing right or wrong in what you do in life. 
So, you're not really sure how you stand in front of God. 
So, when you go to the temple, all you seek is an audience with God. 
You want to see God. 
And you want God to see you, and hence the gods have very large eyes, large unblinking eyes, sometimes made of silver, so they look at you. 
Because you don't know whether you're right or wrong, and so all you seek is divine empathy. 
"Just know where I came from, why I did the Jugaad." 
(Laughter) "Why did I do the setting, why I don't care for the processes. Just understand me, please." 
And based on this, we created a ritual for leaders. 
After a leader completes his training and is about to take over the store, we blindfold him, we surround him with the stakeholders, the customer, his family, his team, his boss. 
You read out his KRA, his KPI, you give him the keys, and then you remove the blindfold. 
And invariably, you see a tear, because the penny has dropped. 
He realizes that to succeed, he does not have to be a "professional," he does not have to cut out his emotions, he has to include all these people in his world to succeed, to make them happy, to make the boss happy, to make everyone happy. 
The customer is happy, because the customer is God. 
That sensitivity is what we need. Once this belief enters, behavior will happen, business will happen. 
And it has. 
So, then we come back to Alexander and to the gymnosophist. 
And everybody asks me, "Which is the better way, this way or that way?" 
And it's a very dangerous question, because it leads you to the path of fundamentalism and violence. 
So, I will not answer the question. 
What I will give you is an Indian answer, the Indian head-shake. 
(Laughter) (Applause) Depending on the context, depending on the outcome, choose your paradigm. 
You see, because both the paradigms are human constructions. 
They are cultural creations, not natural phenomena. 
And so the next time you meet someone, a stranger, one request: Understand that you live in the subjective truth, and so does he. 
Understand it. 
And when you understand it you will discover something spectacular. 
You will discover that within infinite myths lies the eternal truth. 
Who sees it all? 
Varuna has but a thousand eyes. 
Indra, a hundred. 
You and I, only two. 
Thank you. Namaste. 
(Applause) 

This is really a two-hour presentation I give to high school students, cut down to three minutes. 
And it all started one day on a plane, on my way to TED, seven years ago. 
And in the seat next to me was a high school student, a teenager, and she came from a really poor family. 
And she wanted to make something of her life, and she asked me a simple little question. 
She said, "What leads to success?" 
And I felt really badly, because I couldn't give her a good answer. 
So I get off the plane, and I come to TED. 
And I think, jeez, I'm in the middle of a room of successful people! 
So why don't I ask them what helped them succeed, and pass it on to kids? 
So here we are, seven years, 500 interviews later, and I'm going to tell you what really leads to success and makes TEDsters tick. 
And the first thing is passion. 
Freeman Thomas says, "I'm driven by my passion." 
TEDsters do it for love; they don't do it for money. 
Carol Coletta says, "I would pay someone to do what I do." 
And the interesting thing is: if you do it for love, the money comes anyway. 
Work! Rupert Murdoch said to me, "It's all hard work. 
Nothing comes easily. But I have a lot of fun." 
Did he say fun? Rupert? Yes! 
(Laughter) TEDsters do have fun working. And they work hard. 
I figured, they're not workaholics. They're workafrolics. 
(Laughter) Good! 
(Applause) Alex Garden says, "To be successful, put your nose down in something and get damn good at it." 
There's no magic; it's practice, practice, practice. 
And it's focus. 
Norman Jewison said to me, "I think it all has to do with focusing yourself on one thing." 
And push! 
David Gallo says, "Push yourself. 
Physically, mentally, you've got to push, push, push." 
You've got to push through shyness and self-doubt. 
Goldie Hawn says, "I always had self-doubts. 
I wasn't good enough; I wasn't smart enough. 
I didn't think I'd make it." 
Now it's not always easy to push yourself, and that's why they invented mothers. 
(Laughter) (Applause) Frank Gehry said to me, "My mother pushed me." 
(Laughter) Serve! 
Sherwin Nuland says, "It was a privilege to serve as a doctor." 
A lot of kids want to be millionaires. 
The first thing I say is: "OK, well you can't serve yourself; you've got to serve others something of value. 
Because that's the way people really get rich." 
Ideas! 
TEDster Bill Gates says, "I had an idea: founding the first micro-computer software company." 
I'd say it was a pretty good idea. 
And there's no magic to creativity in coming up with ideas -- it's just doing some very simple things. 
And I give lots of evidence. 
Persist! 
Joe Kraus says, "Persistence is the number one reason for our success." 
You've got to persist through failure. You've got to persist through crap! 
Which of course means "Criticism, Rejection, Assholes and Pressure." 
(Laughter) So, the answer to this question is simple: Pay 4,000 bucks and come to TED. 
(Laughter) Or failing that, do the eight things -- and trust me, these are the big eight things that lead to success. 
Thank you TEDsters for all your interviews! 
(Applause) 

For emotions, we should not move quickly to the desert. 
So, first, a small housekeeping announcement: please switch off your proper English check programs installed in your brain. 
(Applause) So, welcome to the Golden Desert, Indian desert. 
It receives the least rainfall in the country, lowest rainfall. 
If you are well-versed with inches, nine inches, centimeters, 16 [centimeters]. 
The groundwater is 300 feet deep, 100 meters. 
And in most parts it is saline, not fit for drinking. 
So, you can't install hand pumps or dig wells, though there is no electricity in most of the villages. 
But suppose you use the green technology, solar pumps -- they are of no use in this area. 
So, welcome to the Golden Desert. 
Clouds seldom visit this area. 
But we find 40 different names of clouds in this dialect used here. 
There are a number of techniques to harvest rain. 
This is a new work, it's a new program. 
But for the desert society this is no program; this is their life. 
And they harvest rain in many ways. 
So, this is the first device they use in harvesting rain. 
It's called kunds; somewhere it is called [unclear]. 
And you can notice they have created a kind of false catchment. 
The desert is there, sand dunes, some small field. 
And this is all big raised platform. 
You can notice the small holes the water will fall on this catchment, and there is a slope. 
Sometimes our engineers and architects do not care about slopes in bathrooms, but here they will care properly. 
And the water will go where it should go. 
And then it is 40 feet deep. 
The waterproofing is done perfectly, better than our city contractors, because not a single drop should go waste in this. 
They collect 100 thousand liters in one season. 
And this is pure drinking water. 
Below the surface there is hard saline water. 
But now you can have this for year round. 
It's two houses. 
We often use a term called bylaws. 
Because we are used to get written things. 
But here it is unwritten by law. 
And people made their house, and the water storage tanks. 
These raised up platforms just like this stage. 
In fact they go 15 feet deep, and collect rain water from roof, there is a small pipe, and from their courtyard. 
It can also harvest something like 25,000 in a good monsoon. 
Another big one, this is of course out of the hardcore desert area. 
This is near Jaipur. This is called the Jaigarh Fort. 
And it can collect six million gallons of rainwater in one season. 
The age is 400 years. 
So, since 400 years it has been giving you almost six million gallons of water per season. 
You can calculate the price of that water. 
It draws water from 15 kilometers of canals. 
You can see a modern road, hardly 50 years old. 
It can break sometimes. 
But this 400 year old canal, which draws water, it is maintained for so many generations. 
Of course if you want to go inside, the two doors are locked. 
But they can be opened for TED people. 
(Laughter) And we request them. 
You can see person coming up with two canisters of water. 
And the water level -- these are not empty canisters -- water level is right up to this. 
It can envy many municipalities, the color, the taste, the purity of this water. 
And this is what they call Zero B type of water, because it comes from the clouds, pure distilled water. 
We stop for a quick commercial break, and then we come back to the traditional systems. 
The government thought that this is a very backward area and we should bring a multi-million dollar project to bring water from the Himalayas. 
That's why I said that this is a commercial break. 
(Laughter) But we will come back, once again, to the traditional thing. 
So, water from 300, 400 kilometers away, soon it become like this. 
In many portions, water hyacinth covered these big canals like anything. 
Of course there are some areas where water is reaching, I'm not saying that it is not reaching at all. 
But the tail end, the Jaisalmer area, you will notice in Bikaner things like this: where the water hyacinth couldn't grow, the sand is flowing in these canals. 
The bonus is that you can find wildlife around it. 
(Laughter) We had full-page advertisements, some 30 years, 25 years ago when this canal came. 
They said that throw away your traditional systems, these new cement tanks will supply you piped water. 
It's a dream. And it became a dream also. 
Because soon the water was not able to reach these areas. 
And people started renovating their own structures. 
These are all traditional water structures, which we won't be able to explain in such a short time. 
But you can see that no woman is standing on those. 
(Laughter) And they are plaiting hair. 
(Applause) Jaisalmer. This is heart of desert. 
This town was established 800 years ago. 
I'm not sure by that time Bombay was there, or Delhi was there, or Chennai was there, or Bangalore was there. 
So, this was the terminal point for silk route. 
Well connected, 800 years ago, through Europe. 
None of us were able to go to Europe, but Jaisalmer was well connected to it. 
And this is the 16 centimeter area. 
Such a limited rainfall, and highest colorful life flourished in these areas. 
You won't find water in this slide. 
But it is invisible. 
Somewhere a stream or a rivulet is running through here. 
Or, if you want to paint, you can paint it blue throughout because every roof which you see in this picture collects rainwater drops and deposit in the rooms. 
But apart from this system, they designed 52 beautiful water bodies around this town. 
And what we call private public partnership you can add estate also. 
So, estate, public and private entrepreneurs work together to build this beautiful water body. 
And it's a kind of water body for all seasons. 
You will admire it. Just behold the beauty throughout the year. 
Whether water level goes up or down, the beauty is there throughout. 
Another water body, dried up, of course, during the summer period, but you can see how the traditional society combines engineering with aesthetics, with the heart. 
These statues, marvelous statues, gives you an idea of water table. 
When this rain comes and the water starts filling this tank, it will submerge these beautiful statues in what we call in English today "mass communication." 
This was for mass communication. 
Everybody in the town will know that this elephant has drowned, so water will be there for seven months or nine months, or 12 months. 
And then they will come and worship this pond, pay respect, their gratitude. 
Another small water body, called the [unclear]. 
It is difficult to translate in English, especially in my English. 
But the nearest would be "glory," a reputation. 
The reputation in desert of this small water body is that it never dries up. 
In severe drought periods nobody has seen this water body getting dried up. 
And perhaps they knew the future also. 
It was designed some 150 years ago. 
But perhaps they knew that on sixth, November, 2009, there will be a TED green and blue session, so they painted it like this. 
(Laughter) (Applause) Dry water body. Children are standing on a very difficult device to explain. 
This is called kund. We have, in English, surface water and ground water. 
But this is not ground water. 
You can draw ground water from any well. 
But this is no ordinary well. 
It squeeze the moisture hidden in the sand. 
And they have dubbed this water as the third one called [unclear]. 
And there is a gypsum belt running below it. 
And it was deposited by the great mother Earth, some three million years ago. 
And where we have this gypsum strip they can harvest this water. 
This is the same dry water body. 
Now, you don't find any kund; they are all submerged. 
But when the water goes down they will be able to draw water from those structures throughout the year. 
This year they have received only six centimeters. 
Six centimeter of rainfall, and they can telephone you that if you find any water problem in your city, Delhi, Bombay, Bangalore, Mysore, please come to our area of six centimeters, we can give you water. 
(Laughter) How they maintain them? 
There are three things: concept, planning, making the actual thing, and also maintaining them. 
It is a structure for maintain, for centuries, by generations, without any department, without any funding, So the secret is "[unclear]," respect. 
Your own thing, not personal property, my property, every time. 
So, these stone pillars will remind you that you are entering into a water body area. 
Don't spit, don't do anything wrong, so that the clean water can be collected. 
Another pillar, stone pillar on your right side. 
If you climb these three, six steps you will find something very nice. 
This was done in 11th century. 
And you have to go further down. 
They say that a picture is worth a thousand words, so we can say a thousand words right now, an another thousand words. 
If the water table goes down, you will find new stairs. 
If it comes up, some of them will be submerged. 
So, throughout the year this beautiful system will give you some pleasure. 
Three sides, such steps, on the fourth side there is a four-story building where you can organize such TED conferences anytime. 
(Applause) Excuse me, who built these structures? 
They are in front of you. 
The best civil engineers we had, the best planners, the best architects. 
We can say that because of them, because of their forefathers, India could get the first engineering college in 1847. 
There were no English medium schools at that time, even no Hindi schools, [unclear] schools. 
But such people, compelled to the East India Company, which came here for business, a very dirty kind of business ... 
(Laughter) but not to create the engineering colleges. 
But because of them, first engineering college was created in a small village, not in the town. 
The last point, we all know in our primary schools that that camel is a ship of desert. 
So, you can find through your Jeep, a camel, and a cart. 
This tire comes from the airplane. 
So, look at the beauty from the desert society who can harvest rainwater, and also create something through a tire from a jet plane, and used in a camel cart. 
Last picture, it's a tattoo, 2,000-years-old tattoo. 
They were using it on their body. 
Tattoo was, at one time, a kind of a blacklisted or con thing, but now it is in thing. 
(Laughter) (Applause) You can copy this tattoo. I have some posters of this. 
(Laughter) The center of life is water. 
These are the beautiful waves. 
These are the beautiful stairs which we just saw in one of the slides. 
These are the trees. 
And these are the flowers which add fragrance to our lives. 
So, this is the message of desert. 
Thank you very much. 
(Applause) Chris Anderson: So, first of all, I wish I had your eloquence, truly, in any language. 
(Applause) These artifacts and designs are inspiring. 
Do you believe that they can be used elsewhere, that the world can learn from this? 
Or is this just right for this place? 
Anupam Mishra: No, the basic idea is to utilize water that falls on our area. 
So, the ponds, the open bodies, are everywhere, right from Sri Lanka to Kashmir, and in other parts also. 
And these [unclear], which stored water, there are two type of things. 
One recharge, and one stores. 
So, it depends on the terrain. 
But kund, which uses the gypsum belt, for that you have to go back to your calendar, three million years ago. 
If it is there it can be done right now. 
Otherwise, it can't be done. 
(Laughter) (Applause) CA: Thank you so much. 
(Applause) 

Good morning. 
I've come here to share with you an experiment of how to get rid of one form of human suffering. 
It really is a story of Dr. Venkataswamy. 
His mission and his message is about the Aravind Eye Care System. 
I think first it's important for us to recognize what it is to be blind. 
(Music) Woman: Everywhere I went looking for work, they said no, what use do we have for a blind woman? 
I couldn't thread a needle or see the lice in my hair. 
If an ant fell into my rice, I couldn't see that either. 
Thulasiraj Ravilla: Becoming blind is a big part of it, but I think it also deprives the person of their livelihood, their dignity, their independence, and their status in the family. 
So she is just one amongst the millions who are blind. 
And the irony is that they don't need to be. 
A simple, well-proven surgery can restore sight to millions, and something even simpler, a pair of glasses, can make millions more see. 
If we add to that the many of us here now who are more productive because they have a pair of glasses, then almost one in five Indians will require eye care, a staggering 200 million people. 
Today, we're reaching not even 10 percent of them. 
So this is the context in which Aravind came into existence about 30 years back as a post-retirement project of Dr. V. 
He started this with no money. 
He had to mortgage all his life savings to make a bank loan. 
And over time, we have grown into a network of five hospitals, predominately in the state of Tamil Nadu and Puducherry, and then we added several, what we call Vision Centers as a hub-and-spoke model. 
And then more recently we started managing hospitals in other parts of the country and also setting up hospitals in other parts of the world as well. 
The last three decades, we have done about three-and-a-half million surgeries, a vast majority of them for the poor people. 
Now, each year we perform about 300,000 surgeries. 
A typical day at Aravind, we would do about a thousand surgeries, maybe see about 6,000 patients, send out teams into the villages to examine, bring back patients, lots of telemedicine consultations, and, on top of that, do a lot of training, both for doctors and technicians who will become the future staff of Aravind. 
And then doing this day-in and day-out, and doing it well, requires a lot of inspiration and a lot of hard work. 
And I think this was possible thanks to the building blocks put in place by Dr. V., a value system, an efficient delivery process, and fostering the culture of innovation. 
(Music) Dr. V: I used to sit with the ordinary village man because I am from a village, and suddenly you turn around and seem to be in contact with his inner being, you seem to be one with him. 
Here is a soul which has got all the simplicity of confidence. 
Doctor, whatever you say, I accept it. 
An implicit faith in you and then you respond to it. 
Here is an old lady who has got so much faith in me, I must do my best for her. 
When we grow in spiritual consciousness, we identify ourselves with all that is in the world, so there is no exploitation. 
It is ourselves we are helping. 
It is ourselves we are healing. 
(Applause) This helped us build a very ethical and very highly patient-centric organization and systems that support it. 
But on a practical level, you also have to deliver services efficiently, and, odd as it may seem, the inspiration came from McDonald's. 
Dr. V: See, McDonald's' concept is simple. 
They feel they can train people all over the world, irrespective of different religions, cultures, all those things, to produce a product in the same way and deliver it in the same manner in hundreds of places. 
Larry Brilliant: He kept talking about McDonalds and hamburgers, and none of it made any sense to us. 
He wanted to create a franchise, a mechanism of delivery of eye care with the efficiency of McDonald's. 
Dr. V: Supposing I'm able to produce eye care, techniques, methods, all in the same way, and make it available in every corner of the world. 
The problem of blindness is gone. 
TR: If you think about it, I think the eyeball is the same, as American or African, the problem is the same, the treatment is the same. 
And yet, why should there be so much variation in quality and in service, and that was the fundamental principle that we followed when we designed the delivery systems. 
And, of course, the challenge was that it's a huge problem, we are talking of millions of people, very little resource to deal with it, and then lots of logistics and affordability issues. 
And then so, one had to constantly innovate. 
And one of the early innovations, which still continues, is to create ownership in the community to the problem, and then engage with them as a partner, and here is one such event. 
Here a community camp just organized by the community themselves, where they find a place, organize volunteers, and then we'll do our part. You know, check their vision, and then you have doctors who you find out what the problem is and then determine what further testing should be done, and then those tests are done by technicians who check for glasses, or check for glaucoma. 
And then, with all these results, the doctor makes a final diagnosis, and then prescribes a line of treatment, and if they need a pair of glasses, they are available right there at the camp site, usually under a tree. 
But they get glasses in the frames of their choice, and that's very important because I think glasses, in addition to helping people see, is also a fashion statement, and they're willing to pay for it. 
So they get it in about 20 minutes and those who require surgery, are counseled, and then there are buses waiting, which will transport them to the base hospital. 
And if it was not for this kind of logistics and support, many people like this would probably never get services, and certainly not when they most need it. 
They receive surgery the following day, and then they will stay for a day or two, and then they are put back on the buses to be taken back to where they came from, and where their families will be waiting to take them back home. 
(Applause) And this happens several thousand times each year. 
It may sound impressive that we're seeing lots of patients, very efficient process, but we looked at, are we solving the problem? 
We did a study, a scientifically designed process, and then, to our dismay, we found this was only reaching seven percent of those in need, and we're not adequately addressing more, bigger problems. 
So we had to do something different, so we set up what we call primary eye care centers, vision centers. 
These are truly paperless offices with completely electronic medical records and so on. 
They receive comprehensive eye exams. 
We kind of changed the simple digital camera into a retinal camera, and then every patient gets their teleconsultation with a doctor. 
The effect of this has been that, within the first year, we really had a 40 percent penetration in the market that it served, which is over 50,000 people. 
And the second year went up to 75 percent. 
So I think we have a process by which we can really penetrate into the market and reach everyone who needs it, and in this process of using technology, make sure that most don't need to come to the base hospital. 
And how much will they pay for this? 
We fixed the pricing, taking into account what they would save in bus fare in coming to a city, so they pay about 20 rupees, and that's good for three consultations. 
(Applause) The other challenge was, how do you give high-tech or more advanced treatment and care? 
We designed a van with a VSAT, which sends out images of patients to the base hospital where it is diagnosed, and then as the patient is waiting, the report goes back to the patient, it gets printed out, the patient gets it, and then gets a consultation about what they should be doing -- I mean, go see a doctor or come back after six months, and then this happens as a way of bridging the technology competence. 
So the impact of all this has been essentially one of growing the market, because it focused on the non-customer, and then by reaching the unreached, we're able to significantly grow the market. 
The other aspect is how do you deal with this efficiently when you have very few ophthalmologists? 
So what is in this video is a surgeon operating, and then you see on the other side, another patient is getting ready. 
So, as they finish the surgery, they just swing the microscope over, the tables are placed so that their distance is just right, and then we need to do this, because, by doing this kind of process, we're able to more than quadruple the productivity of the surgeon. 
And then to support the surgeon, we require a certain workforce. 
And then we focused on village girls that we recruited, and then they really are the backbone of the organization. 
They do almost all of the skill-based routine tasks. 
They do one thing at a time. They do it extremely well. 
With the result we have very high productivity, very high quality at very, very low cost. 
So, putting all this together, what really happened was the productivity of our staff was significantly higher than anyone else. 
(Applause) This is a very busy table, but what this really is conveying is that, when it comes to quality, we have put in very good quality-assurance systems. 
As a result, our complications are significantly lower than what has been reported in the United Kingdom, and you don't see those kind of numbers very often. 
(Applause) So the final part of the puzzle is, how do you make all this work financially, especially when the people can't pay for it? 
So what we did was, we gave away a lot of it for free, and then those who pay, I mean, they paid local market rates, nothing more, and often much less. 
And we were helped by the market inefficiency. 
I think that has been a big savior, even now. 
And, of course, one needs the mindset to be wanting to give away what you have as a surplus. 
The result has been, over the years, the expenditure has increased with volumes. 
The revenues increase at a higher level, giving us a healthy margin while you're treating a large number of people for free. 
I think in absolute terms, last year we earned about 20-odd million dollars, spent about 13 million, with over a 40 percent EBITA. 
(Applause) But this really requires going beyond what we do, or what we have done, if you really want to achieve solving this problem of blindness. 
And what we did was a couple of very counter-intuitive things. 
We created competition for ourselves, and then we made eye care affordable by making low-cost consumables. 
We proactively and systematically promoted these practices to many hospitals in India, many in our own backyards and then in other parts of the world as well. 
The impact of this has been that these hospitals, in the second year after our consultation, are double their output and then achieve financial recovery as well. 
The other part was how do you address this increase in cost of technology? 
There was a time when we failed to negotiate the [intra-ocular lens] prices to be at affordable levels, so we set up a manufacturing unit. 
And then, over time, we were able to bring down the cost significantly to about two percent of what it used to be when we started out. 
Today, we believe we have about seven percent of the global market, and they're used in about 120-odd countries. 
To conclude, I mean, what we do, does it have a broader relevance, or is it just India or developing countries? 
So to address this, we studied UK versus Aravind. 
What it shows is that we do roughly about 60 percent of the volume of what the UK does, near a half-million surgeries as a whole country. 
And we do about 300,000. 
And then we train about 50 ophthalmologists against the 70 trained by them, comparable quality, both in training and in patient care. 
So we're really comparing apples to apples. 
We looked at cost. 
(Laughter) (Applause) So, I think it is simple to say just because the U.K. isn't India the difference is happening. 
I think there is more to it. 
I mean, I think one has to look at other aspects as well. 
Maybe there is -- the solution to the cost could be in productivity, maybe in efficiency, in the clinical process, or in how much they pay for the lenses or consumables, or regulations, their defensive practice. 
So, I think decoding this can probably bring answers to most developed countries including the U.S., and maybe Obama's ratings can go up again. 
(Laughter) Another insight, which, again, I want to leave with you, in conditions where the problem is very large, which cuts across all economic strata, where we have a good solution, I think the process I described, you know, productivity, quality, patient-centered care, can give an answer, and there are many which fit this paradigm. 
You take dentistry, hearing aid, maternity and so on. 
There are many where this paradigm can now play, but I think probably one of the most challenging things is on the softer side. 
Now, how do you create compassion? 
Now, how do you make people own the problem, want to do something about it? 
There are a bit harder issues. 
And I'm sure people in this crowd can probably find the solutions to these. 
So I want to end my talk leaving this thought and challenge to you. 
Dr. V: When you grow in spiritual consciousness, we identify with all that is in the world so there is no exploitation. 
It is ourselves we are helping. 
It is ourselves we are healing. 
TR: Thank you very much. 
(Applause) 

(Music) (Applause) (Music) (Music) (Applause) (Music) (Applause) (Applause) Herbie Hancock: Thank you. 
Marcus Miller. (Applause) Harvey Mason. (Applause) Thank you. Thank you very much. (Applause) 

I'm going to talk today about energy and climate. 
And that might seem a bit surprising, because my full-time work at the foundation is mostly about vaccines and seeds, about the things that we need to invent and deliver to help the poorest two billion live better lives. 
But energy and climate are extremely important to these people; in fact, more important than to anyone else on the planet. 
The climate getting worse means that many years, their crops won't grow: there will be too much rain, not enough rain; things will change in ways their fragile environment simply can't support. 
And that leads to starvation, it leads to uncertainty, it leads to unrest. 
So, the climate changes will be terrible for them. 
Also, the price of energy is very important to them. 
In fact, if you could pick just one thing to lower the price of to reduce poverty, by far you would pick energy. 
Now, the price of energy has come down over time. 
Really advanced civilization is based on advances in energy. 
The coal revolution fueled the Industrial Revolution, and, even in the 1900s, we've seen a very rapid decline in the price of electricity, and that's why we have refrigerators, air-conditioning; we can make modern materials and do so many things. 
And so, we're in a wonderful situation with electricity in the rich world. 
But as we make it cheaper -- and let's say, let's go for making it twice as cheap -- we need to meet a new constraint, and that constraint has to do with CO2. 
CO2 is warming the planet, and the equation on CO2 is actually a very straightforward one. 
If you sum up the CO2 that gets emitted, that leads to a temperature increase, and that temperature increase leads to some very negative effects: the effects on the weather; perhaps worse, the indirect effects, in that the natural ecosystems can't adjust to these rapid changes, and so you get ecosystem collapses. 
Now, the exact amount of how you map from a certain increase of CO2 to what temperature will be, and where the positive feedbacks are -- there's some uncertainty there, but not very much. 
And there's certainly uncertainty about how bad those effects will be, but they will be extremely bad. 
I asked the top scientists on this several times: Do we really have to get down to near zero? 
Can't we just cut it in half or a quarter? 
And the answer is, until we get near to zero, the temperature will continue to rise. 
And so that's a big challenge. 
It's very different than saying, "We're a twelve-foot-high truck trying to get under a ten-foot bridge, and we can just sort of squeeze under." 
This is something that has to get to zero. 
Now, we put out a lot of carbon dioxide every year -- over 26 billion tons. 
For each American, it's about 20 tons. 
For people in poor countries, it's less than one ton. 
It's an average of about five tons for everyone on the planet. 
And somehow, we have to make changes that will bring that down to zero. 
It's been constantly going up. 
It's only various economic changes that have even flattened it at all, so we have to go from rapidly rising to falling, and falling all the way to zero. 
This equation has four factors, a little bit of multiplication. 
So you've got a thing on the left, CO2, that you want to get to zero, and that's going to be based on the number of people, the services each person is using on average, the energy, on average, for each service, and the CO2 being put out per unit of energy. 
So let's look at each one of these, and see how we can get this down to zero. 
Probably, one of these numbers is going to have to get pretty near to zero. 
(Laughter) That's back from high school algebra. 
But let's take a look. 
First, we've got population. 
The world today has 6.8 billion people. 
That's headed up to about nine billion. 
Now, if we do a really great job on new vaccines, health care, reproductive health services, we could lower that by, perhaps, 10 or 15 percent. 
But there, we see an increase of about 1.3. 
The second factor is the services we use. 
This encompasses everything: the food we eat, clothing, TV, heating. 
These are very good things. 
Getting rid of poverty means providing these services to almost everyone on the planet. 
And it's a great thing for this number to go up. 
In the rich world, perhaps the top one billion, we probably could cut back and use less, but every year, this number, on average, is going to go up, and so, overall, that will more than double the services delivered per person. 
Here we have a very basic service: Do you have lighting in your house to be able to read your homework? 
And, in fact, these kids don't, so they're going out and reading their schoolwork under the street lamps. 
Now, efficiency, "E," the energy for each service -- here, finally we have some good news. 
We have something that's not going up. 
Through various inventions and new ways of doing lighting, through different types of cars, different ways of building buildings -- there are a lot of services where you can bring the energy for that service down quite substantially. 
Some individual services even bring it down by 90 percent. 
There are other services, like how we make fertilizer, or how we do air transport, where the rooms for improvement are far, far less. 
And so overall, if we're optimistic, we may get a reduction of a factor of three to even, perhaps, a factor of six. 
But for these first three factors now, we've gone from 26 billion to, at best, maybe 13 billion tons, and that just won't cut it. 
So let's look at this fourth factor -- this is going to be a key one -- and this is the amount of CO2 put out per each unit of energy. 
So the question is: Can you actually get that to zero? 
If you burn coal, no. 
If you burn natural gas, no. 
Almost every way we make electricity today, except for the emerging renewables and nuclear, puts out CO2. 
And so, what we're going to have to do at a global scale, is create a new system. 
So we need energy miracles. 
Now, when I use the term "miracle," I don't mean something that's impossible. 
The microprocessor is a miracle. 
The personal computer is a miracle. 
The Internet and its services are a miracle. 
So the people here have participated in the creation of many miracles. 
Usually, we don't have a deadline where you have to get the miracle by a certain date. 
Usually, you just kind of stand by, and some come along, some don't. 
This is a case where we actually have to drive at full speed and get a miracle in a pretty tight timeline. 
Now, I thought, "How could I really capture this? 
Is there some kind of natural illustration, some demonstration that would grab people's imagination here?" 
I thought back to a year ago when I brought mosquitoes, and somehow people enjoyed that. 
(Laughter) It really got them involved in the idea of, you know, there are people who live with mosquitoes. 
With energy, all I could come up with is this. 
I decided that releasing fireflies would be my contribution to the environment here this year. 
So here we have some natural fireflies. 
I'm told they don't bite; in fact, they might not even leave that jar. 
(Laughter) Now, there's all sorts of gimmicky solutions like that one, but they don't really add up to much. 
We need solutions, either one or several, that have unbelievable scale and unbelievable reliability. 
And although there's many directions that people are seeking, I really only see five that can achieve the big numbers. 
I've left out tide, geothermal, fusion, biofuels. 
Those may make some contribution, and if they can do better than I expect, so much the better. 
But my key point here is that we're going to have to work on each of these five, and we can't give up any of them because they look daunting, because they all have significant challenges. 
Let's look first at burning fossil fuels, either burning coal or burning natural gas. 
What you need to do there seems like it might be simple, but it's not. 
And that's to take all the CO2, after you've burned it, going out the flue, pressurize it, create a liquid, put it somewhere, and hope it stays there. 
Now, we have some pilot things that do this at the 60 to 80 percent level. 
But getting up to that full percentage -- that will be very tricky. 
And agreeing on where these CO2 quantities should be put will be hard, but the toughest one here is this long-term issue: Who's going to be sure? 
Who's going to guarantee something that is literally billions of times larger than any type of waste you think of in terms of nuclear or other things? 
This is a lot of volume. 
So that's a tough one. 
Next would be nuclear. 
It also has three big problems: cost, particularly in highly regulated countries, is high; the issue of safety, really feeling good about nothing could go wrong, that, even though you have these human operators, the fuel doesn't get used for weapons. 
And then what do you do with the waste? 
Although it's not very large, there are a lot of concerns about that. 
People need to feel good about it. 
So three very tough problems that might be solvable, and so, should be worked on. 
The last three of the five, I've grouped together. 
These are what people often refer to as the renewable sources. 
And they actually -- although it's great they don't require fuel -- they have some disadvantages. 
One is that the density of energy gathered in these technologies is dramatically less than a power plant. 
This is energy farming, so you're talking about many square miles, thousands of times more area than you think of as a normal energy plant. 
Also, these are intermittent sources. 
The sun doesn't shine all day, it doesn't shine every day, and likewise, the wind doesn't blow all the time. 
And so, if you depend on these sources, you have to have some way of getting the energy during those time periods that it's not available. 
So we've got big cost challenges here. 
We have transmission challenges; for example, say this energy source is outside your country, you not only need the technology, but you have to deal with the risk of the energy coming from elsewhere. 
And, finally, this storage problem. 
To dimensionalize this, I went through and looked at all the types of batteries made -- for cars, for computers, for phones, for flashlights, for everything -- and compared that to the amount of electrical energy the world uses. 
What I found is that all the batteries we make now could store less than 10 minutes of all the energy. 
And so, in fact, we need a big breakthrough here, something that's going to be a factor of 100 better than the approaches we have now. 
It's not impossible, but it's not a very easy thing. 
Now, this shows up when you try to get the intermittent source to be above, say, 20 to 30 percent of what you're using. 
If you're counting on it for 100 percent, you need an incredible miracle battery. 
Now, how are we going to go forward on this -- what's the right approach? 
Is it a Manhattan Project? What's the thing that can get us there? 
Well, we need lots of companies working on this -- hundreds. 
In each of these five paths, we need at least a hundred people. 
A lot of them, you'll look at and say, "They're crazy." 
That's good. 
And, I think, here in the TED group, we have many people who are already pursuing this. 
Bill Gross has several companies, including one called eSolar that has some great solar thermal technologies. 
Vinod Khosla is investing in dozens of companies that are doing great things and have interesting possibilities, and I'm trying to help back that. 
Nathan Myhrvold and I actually are backing a company that, perhaps surprisingly, is actually taking the nuclear approach. 
There are some innovations in nuclear: modular, liquid. 
Innovation really stopped in this industry quite some ago, so the idea that there's some good ideas laying around is not all that surprising. 
The idea of TerraPower is that, instead of burning a part of uranium -- the one percent, which is the U235 -- we decided, "Let's burn the 99 percent, the U238." 
It is kind of a crazy idea. 
In fact, people had talked about it for a long time, but they could never simulate properly whether it would work or not, and so it's through the advent of modern supercomputers that now you can simulate and see that, yes, with the right materials approach, this looks like it would work. 
And because you're burning that 99 percent, you have greatly improved cost profile. 
You actually burn up the waste, and you can actually use as fuel all the leftover waste from today's reactors. 
So instead of worrying about them, you just take that, it's a great thing. 
It breeds this uranium as it goes along, so it's kind of like a candle. 
You see it's a log there, often referred to as a traveling wave reactor. 
In terms of fuel, this really solves the problem. 
I've got a picture here of a place in Kentucky. 
This is the leftover, the 99 percent, where they've taken out the part they burn now, so it's called depleted uranium. 
That would power the US for hundreds of years. 
And simply by filtering seawater in an inexpensive process, you'd have enough fuel for the entire lifetime of the rest of the planet. 
So, you know, it's got lots of challenges ahead, but it is an example of the many hundreds and hundreds of ideas that we need to move forward. 
So let's think: How should we measure ourselves? 
What should our report card look like? 
Well, let's go out to where we really need to get, and then look at the intermediate. 
For 2050, you've heard many people talk about this 80 percent reduction. 
That really is very important, that we get there. 
And that 20 percent will be used up by things going on in poor countries -- still some agriculture; hopefully, we will have cleaned up forestry, cement. 
So, to get to that 80 percent, the developed countries, including countries like China, will have had to switch their electricity generation altogether. 
The other grade is: Are we deploying this zero-emission technology, have we deployed it in all the developed countries and are in the process of getting it elsewhere? 
That's super important. 
That's a key element of making that report card. 
Backing up from there, what should the 2020 report card look like? 
Well, again, it should have the two elements. 
We should go through these efficiency measures to start getting reductions: The less we emit, the less that sum will be of CO2, and therefore, the less the temperature. 
But in some ways, the grade we get there, doing things that don't get us all the way to the big reductions, is only equally, or maybe even slightly less, important than the other, which is the piece of innovation on these breakthroughs. 
These breakthroughs, we need to move those at full speed, and we can measure that in terms of companies, pilot projects, regulatory things that have been changed. 
There's a lot of great books that have been written about this. 
The Al Gore book, "Our Choice," and the David MacKay book, "Sustainable Energy Without the Hot Air." 
They really go through it and create a framework that this can be discussed broadly, because we need broad backing for this. 
There's a lot that has to come together. 
So this is a wish. 
It's a very concrete wish that we invent this technology. 
If you gave me only one wish for the next 50 years -- I could pick who's president, I could pick a vaccine, which is something I love, or I could pick that this thing that's half the cost with no CO2 gets invented -- this is the wish I would pick. 
This is the one with the greatest impact. 
If we don't get this wish, the division between the people who think short term and long term will be terrible, between the US and China, between poor countries and rich, and most of all, the lives of those two billion will be far worse. 
So what do we have to do? 
What am I appealing to you to step forward and drive? 
We need to go for more research funding. 
When countries get together in places like Copenhagen, they shouldn't just discuss the CO2. 
They should discuss this innovation agenda. 
You'd be stunned at the ridiculously low levels of spending on these innovative approaches. 
We do need the market incentives -- CO2 tax, cap and trade -- something that gets that price signal out there. 
We need to get the message out. 
We need to have this dialogue be a more rational, more understandable dialogue, including the steps that the government takes. 
This is an important wish, but it is one I think we can achieve. 
Thank you. 
(Applause) (Applause ends) Thank you. 
Chris Anderson: Thank you. Thank you. 
(Applause) CA: Thank you. 
I mean, first of all, can you give a sense of what scale of investment this is? 
Bill Gates: To actually do the software, buy the supercomputer, hire all the great scientists, which we've done, that's only tens of millions. 
And even once we test our materials out in a Russian reactor to make sure our materials work properly, then you'll only be up in the hundreds of millions. 
The tough thing is building the pilot reactor -- finding the several billion, finding the regulator, the location that will actually build the first one of these. 
Once you get the first one built, if it works as advertised, then it's just clear as day, because the economics, the energy density, are so different than nuclear as we know it. 
CA: So to understand it right, this involves building deep into the ground, almost like a vertical column of nuclear fuel, of this spent uranium, and then the process starts at the top and kind of works down? 
BG: That's right. 
Today, you're always refueling the reactor, so you have lots of people and lots of controls that can go wrong, where you're opening it up and moving things in and out -- that's not good. 
So if you have very -- (Laughter) very cheap fuel that you can put 60 years in -- just think of it as a log -- put it down and not have those same complexities. 
And it just sits there and burns for the 60 years, and then it's done. 
CA: It's a nuclear power plant that is its own waste disposal solution. 
BG: Yeah; what happens with the waste, you can let it sit there -- there's a lot less waste under this approach -- then you can actually take that and put it into another one and burn that. 
And we start out, actually, by taking the waste that exists today that's sitting in these cooling pools or dry-casking by reactors -- that's our fuel to begin with. 
So the thing that's been a problem from those reactors is actually what gets fed into ours, and you're reducing the volume of the waste quite dramatically as you're going through this process. 
CA: You're talking to different people around the world about the possibilities. 
Where is there most interest in actually doing something with this? 
BG: Well, we haven't picked a particular place, and there's all these interesting disclosure rules about anything that's called "nuclear." 
So we've got a lot of interest. 
People from the company have been in Russia, India, China. 
I've been back seeing the secretary of energy here, talking about how this fits into the energy agenda. 
So I'm optimistic. 
This is a variant on something that has been done. 
It's an important advance, but it's like a fast reactor, and a lot of countries have built them, so anybody who's done a fast reactor is a candidate to be where the first one gets built. 
CA: So, in your mind, timescale and likelihood of actually taking something like this live? 
BG: Well, we need -- for one of these high-scale, electro-generation things that's very cheap, we have 20 years to invent and then 20 years to deploy. 
That's sort of the deadline that the environmental models have shown us that we have to meet. 
And TerraPower -- if things go well, which is wishing for a lot -- could easily meet that. 
And there are, fortunately now, dozens of companies -- we need it to be hundreds -- who, likewise, if their science goes well, if the funding for their pilot plants goes well, that they can compete for this. 
And it's best if multiple succeed, because then you could use a mix of these things. 
We certainly need one to succeed. 
CA: In terms of big-scale possible game changers, is this the biggest that you're aware of out there? 
BG: An energy breakthrough is the most important thing. 
It would have been, even without the environmental constraint, but the environmental constraint just makes it so much greater. 
In the nuclear space, there are other innovators. 
You know, we don't know their work as well as we know this one, but the modular people, that's a different approach. 
There's a liquid-type reactor, which seems a little hard, but maybe they say that about us. 
And so, there are different ones, but the beauty of this is a molecule of uranium has a million times as much energy as a molecule of, say, coal. 
And so, if you can deal with the negatives, which are essentially the radiation, the footprint and cost, the potential, in terms of effect on land and various things, is almost in a class of its own. 
CA: If this doesn't work, then what? 
Do we have to start taking emergency measures to try and keep the temperature of the earth stable? 
BG: If you get into that situation, it's like if you've been overeating, and you're about to have a heart attack. 
Then where do you go? 
There is a line of research on what's called geoengineering, which are various techniques that would delay the heating to buy us 20 or 30 years to get our act together. 
Now, that's just an insurance policy; you hope you don't need to do that. 
Some people say you shouldn't even work on the insurance policy because it might make you lazy, that you'll keep eating because you know heart surgery will be there to save you. 
I'm not sure that's wise, given the importance of the problem, but there's now the geoengineering discussion about: Should that be in the back pocket in case things happen faster, or this innovation goes a lot slower than we expect? 
CA: Climate skeptics: If you had a sentence or two to say to them, how might you persuade them that they're wrong? 
BG: Well, unfortunately, the skeptics come in different camps. 
The ones who make scientific arguments are very few. 
Are they saying there's negative feedback effects that have to do with clouds that offset things? 
There are very, very few things that they can even say there's a chance in a million of those things. 
The main problem we have here -- it's kind of like with AIDS: you make the mistake now, and you pay for it a lot later. 
And so, when you have all sorts of urgent problems, the idea of taking pain now that has to do with a gain later, and a somewhat uncertain pain thing. 
In fact, the IPCC report -- that's not necessarily the worst case, and there are people in the rich world who look at IPCC and say, "OK, that isn't that big of a deal." 
The fact is it's that uncertain part that should move us towards this. 
But my dream here is that, if you can make it economic, and meet the CO2 constraints, then the skeptics say, "OK, I don't care that it doesn't put out CO2, I kind of wish it did put out CO2. 
But I guess I'll accept it, because it's cheaper than what's come before." 
(Applause) CA: So that would be your response to the Bjørn Lomborg argument, basically if you spend all this energy trying to solve the CO2 problem, it's going to take away all your other goals of trying to rid the world of poverty and malaria and so forth, it's a stupid waste of the Earth's resources to put money towards that when there are better things we can do. 
BG: Well, the actual spending on the R&amp;D piece -- say the US should spend 10 billion a year more than it is right now -- it's not that dramatic. 
It shouldn't take away from other things. 
The thing you get into big money on, and reasonable people can disagree, is when you have something that's non-economic and you're trying to fund that -- that, to me, mostly is a waste. 
Unless you're very close, and you're just funding the learning curve and it's going to get very cheap, I believe we should try more things that have a potential to be far less expensive. 
If the trade-off you get into is, "Let's make energy super expensive," then the rich can afford that. 
I mean, all of us here could pay five times as much for our energy and not change our lifestyle. 
The disaster is for that two billion. 
And even Lomborg has changed. 
His shtick now is, "Why isn't the R&amp;D getting more discussed?" 
He's still, because of his earlier stuff, still associated with the skeptic camp, but he's realized that's a pretty lonely camp, and so, he's making the R&amp;D point. 
And so there is a thread of something that I think is appropriate. 
The R&amp;D piece -- it's crazy how little it's funded. 
CA: Well, Bill, I suspect I speak on behalf of most people here to say I really hope your wish comes true. 
Thank you so much. 
(Applause) 

So, what I'm going to do is just give you the latest episode of India's -- maybe the world's -- longest running soap opera, which is cricket. 
And may it run forever, because it gives people like me a living. 
It's got everything that you'd want a normal soap opera to want: It's got love, joy, happiness, sadness, tears, laughter, lots of deceit, intrigue. 
And like all good soaps, it jumps 20 years when the audience interest changes. 
And that's exactly what cricket has done. 
It's jumped 20 years into 20-over game. 
And that's what I'm going to talk about, how a small change leads to a very big revolution. 
But it wasn't always like that. 
Cricket wasn't always this speed-driven generations game. 
There was a time when you played cricket, you played timeless test matches, when you played on till the game got over. 
And there was this game in March 1939 that started on the third of March and ended on the 14th of March. 
And it only ended because the English cricketers had to go from Durban to Cape Town, which is a two-hour train journey, to catch the ship that left on the 17th, because the next ship wasn't around for a long time. 
So, the match was ended in between. 
And one of the English batsmen said, "You know what? 
Another half an hour and we would have won." 
(Laughter) Another half an hour after 12 days. 
There were two Sundays in between. But of course, Sundays are church days, so you don't play on Sundays. And one day it rained, so they all sat around making friends with each other. 
But there is a reason why India fell in love with cricket: because we had about the same pace of life. 
(Laughter) The Mahabharata was like that as well, wasn't it? 
You fought by day, then it was sunset, so everyone went back home. 
And then you worked out your strategy, and you came and fought the next day, and you went back home again. 
The only difference between the Mahabharata and our cricket was that in cricket, everybody was alive to come back and fight the next day. 
Princes patronize the game, not because they love the game, but because it was a means of ingratiating themselves to the British rulers. 
But there is one other reason why India fell in love with cricket, which was, all you needed was a plank of wood and a rubber ball, and any number of people could play it anywhere. 
Take a look: You could play it in the dump with some rocks over there, you could play it in a little alley -- you couldn't hit square anywhere, because the bat hit the wall; don't forget the air conditioning and the cable wires. 
(Laughter) You could play it on the banks of the Ganges -- that's as clean as the Ganges has been for a long time. 
Or you could play many games in one small patch of land, even if you didn't know which game you were actually in. 
(Laughter) As you can see, you can play anywhere. 
But slowly the game moved on, you know, finally. 
You don't always have five days. So, we moved on, and we started playing 50-over cricket. 
And then an enormous accident took place. 
In Indian sport we don't make things happen, accidents happen and we're in the right place at the right time, sometimes. 
And we won this World Cup in 1983. 
And suddenly we fell in love with the 50-over game, and we played it virtually every day. 
There was more 50-over cricket than anywhere. 
But there was another big date. 
1983 was when we won the World Cup. 
1991,'92, we found a finance minister and a prime minister willing to let the world look at India, rather than be this great country of intrigue and mystery in this closed country. 
And so we allowed multinationals into India. 
We cut customs duties, we reduced import duties, and we got all the multinationals coming in, with multinational budgets, who looked at per-capita income and got very excited about the possibilities in India, and were looking for a vehicle to reach every Indian. 
And there are only two vehicles in India -- one real, one scripted. 
The scripted one is what you see in the movies, the real one was cricket. 
And so one of my friends sitting right here in front of me, Ravi Dhariwal from Pepsi, decided he's going to take it all over the world. 
And Pepsi was this big revolution, because they started taking cricket all over. 
And so cricket started becoming big; cricket started bringing riches in. 
Television started covering cricket. For a long time television said, "We won't cover cricket unless you pay us to cover it." 
Then they said, "OK, the next rights are sold for 55 million dollars. 
The next rights are sold for 612 million dollars." 
So, it's a bit of a curve, that. 
And then another big accident happened in our cricket. 
England invented 20 overs cricket, and said, "The world must play 20 overs cricket." 
Just as England invented cricket, and made the rest of the world play it. 
(Laughter) And so, India had to go and play the T20 World Cup, you see. 
India didn't want to play the T20 World Cup. 
But we were forced to play it by an 8-1 margin. 
We got to the final, and then this moment, that will remain enshrined forever, for everybody, take a look. 
(Crowd cheering) The Pakistani batsman trying to clear the fielder. 
Announcer: And Zishan takes it! India wins! 
What a match for a Twenty20 final. 
India, the world champions. 
(Cheering) India, T20 champions. 
But what a game we had, M. S. Dhoni got it right in the air, but Misbah-ul-Haq, what a player. 
A massive, massive success: India, the world TT champions. 
Harsha Bhogle: Suddenly India discovered this power of 20-overs cricket. 
The accident, of course, there, was that the batsman thought the bowler was bowling fast. 
(Laughter) If he had bowled fast, the ball would have gone where it was meant to go, but it didn't go. And we suddenly discovered that we could be good at this game. 
And what it also did was it led to a certain pride in the fact that India could be the best in the world. 
It was at a time when investment was coming in, India was feeling a little more confident about itself. 
And so there was a feeling that there was great pride in what we can do. 
And thankfully for all of us, the English are very good at inventing things, and then the gracious people that they are, they let the world become very good at it. 
(Laughter) And so England invented T20 cricket, and allowed India to hijack it. 
It was not like reengineering that we do in medicine, we just took it straight away, as is. 
(Laughter) And so, we launched our own T20 league. 
Six weeks, city versus city. 
It was a new thing for us. We had only ever supported our country -- the only two areas in which India was very proud about their country, representing itself on the field. 
One was war, the Indian army, which we don't like to happen very often. 
The other was Indian cricket. 
Now, suddenly we had to support city leagues. 
But the people getting into these city leagues were people who were taking their cues from the West. 
America is a home of leagues. And they said, "Right, we'll build some glitzy leagues here in India." 
Because cricket, for a long time in India was always organized. 
And look what they did with our beautiful, nice, simple family game. 
All of a sudden, you had that happening. 
(Music) An opening ceremony to match every other. 
This was an India that was buying Corvettes. This was an India that was buying Jaguar. 
This was an India that was adding more mobile phones per month than New Zealand's population twice over. 
So, it was a different India. 
But it was also a slightly more orthodox India that was very happy to be modern, but didn't want to say that to people. 
And so, they were aghast when the cheerleaders arrived. 
Everyone secretly watched them, but everyone claimed not to. 
(Music) (Laughter) The new owners of Indian cricket were not the old princes. 
They were not bureaucrats who were forced into sport because they didn't actually love it; these were people who ran serious companies. 
And so they started promoting cricket big time, started promoting clubs big time. 
And they've started promoting them with huge money behind it. 
I mean the IPL had 2.3 billion dollars before a ball was bowled, 1.6 billion dollars for television revenue over 10 years, and another 70 million dollars plus from all these franchises that were putting in money. And then they had to appeal to their cities, but they had to do it like the West, right? Because we are setting up leagues. 
But what they were very good at doing was making it very localized. 
So, just to give you an example of how they did it -- not Manchester United style promotion, but very Mumbai style promotion. Take a look. 
(Music) Of course, a lot of people said, "Maybe they dance better than they play." 
(Laughter) But that's all right. What it did also is it changed the way we looked at cricket. 
All along, if you wanted a young cricketer, you picked him up from the bylanes of your own little locality, your own city, and you were very proud of the system that produced those cricketers. 
Now, all of the sudden, if you were to bowl a shot -- if Mumbai were to bowl a shot, for example, they needn't go to Kalbadevi or Shivaji Park or somewhere to source them, they could go to Trinidad. 
This was the new India, wasn't it? This was the new world, where you can source from anywhere as long as you get the best product at the best price. 
And all of a sudden, Indian sport had awakened to the reality that you can source the best product for the best price anywhere in the world. 
So, the Mumbai Indians flew in Dwayne Bravo from Trinidad and Tobago, overnight. And when he had to go back to represent the West Indies, they asked him, "When do you have to reach?" 
He said, "I have to be there by a certain time, so I have to leave today." 
We said, "No, no, no. It's not about when you have to leave; it's about when do you have to reach there?" 
And so he said, "I've got to reach on date X." 
And they said, "Fine, you play to date X, minus one." 
So, he played in Hyderabad, went, straight after the game, went from the stadium to Hyderabad airport, sat in a private corporate jet -- first refueling in Portugal, second refueling in Brazil; he was in West Indies in time. 
(Laughter) Never would India have thought on this scale before. 
Never would India have said, "I want a player to play one game for me, and I will use a corporate jet to send him all the way back to Kingston, Jamaica to play a game." 
And I just thought to myself, "Wow, we've arrived somewhere in the world, you know? 
We have arrived somewhere. We are thinking big." 
But what this also did was it started marrying the two most important things in Indian cricket, which is cricket and the movies in Indian entertainment. 
There is cricket and the movies. 
And they came together because people in the movies now started owning clubs. 
And so, people started going to the cricket to watch Preity Zinta. 
They started going to the cricket to watch Shah Rukh Khan. 
And something very interesting happened. 
We started getting song and dance in Indian cricket. 
And so it started resembling the Indian movies more and more. 
And of course, if you were on Preity Zinta's team -- as you will see on the clip that follows -- if you did well, you got a hug from Preity Zinta. 
So that was the ultimate reason to do well. Take a look -- everyone's watching Preity Zinta. 
(Music) And then of course there was Shah Rukh playing the Kolkata crowd. 
We'd all seen matches in Kolkata, but we'd never seen anything like this: Shah Rukh, with the Bengali song, getting the audiences all worked up for Kolkata -- not for India, but for Kolkata. 
But take a look at this. 
(Music) An Indian film star hugging a Pakistani cricketer because they'd won in Kolkata. 
Can you imagine? 
And do you know what the Pakistani cricketer said? 
(Applause) "I wish I was playing for Preity Zinta's team." 
(Laughter) But I thought I'd take this opportunity -- there's a few people from Pakistan in here. 
I'm so happy that you're here because I think we can show that we can both be together and be friends, right? 
So thank you very much for coming, all of you from Pakistan. 
(Applause) There was criticism too because they said, "Players are being bought and sold? 
Are they grain? 
Are they cattle?" 
Because we had this auction, you see. 
How do you fix a price for a player? 
And so the auction that followed literally had people saying, "Bang! so many million dollars for so-and-so player." 
There it is. 
(Music) Auctioneer: Going at 1,500,000 dollars. Chennai. 
Shane Warne sold for 450,000 dollars. 
HB: Suddenly, a game which earned its players 50 rupees a day -- so 250 rupees for a test match, but if you finish in four days you only got 200. 
The best Indian players who played every test match -- every one of the internationals, the top of the line players -- standard contracts are 220,000 dollars in a whole year. 
Now they were getting 500,000 for six days' work. 
Then Andrew Flintoff came by from England, he got one and a half million dollars, and he went back and said, "For four weeks, I'm earning more than Frank Lampard and Steven Gerrard, and I'm earning more than the footballers, wow." 
And where was he earning it from? From a little club in India. 
Could you have imagined that day would come? 
One and a half million dollars for six weeks' work. 
That's not bad, is it? 
So, at 2.3 billion dollars before the first ball was bowled. 
What India was doing, though, was benchmarking itself against the best in the world, and it became a huge brand. 
Lalit Modi was on the cover of Business Today. 
IPL became the biggest brand in India and, because our elections, had to be moved to South Africa, and we had to start the tournament in three weeks. 
Move a whole tournament to South Africa in three weeks. 
But we did it. You know why? 
Because no country works as slowly as we do till three weeks before an event, and nobody works fast as we do in the last three weeks. 
(Applause) Our population, which for a long time we thought was a problem, suddenly became our biggest asset because there were more people watching -- the huge consuming class -- everybody came to watch the cricket. 
We'd also made cricket the only sport in India, which is a pity, but in India every other sport pushes cricket to become big, which is a bit of a tragedy of our times. 
Now, this last minute before I go -- there's a couple of side effects of all this. 
For a long time, India was this country of poverty, dust, beggars, snake charmers, filth, Delhi belly -- people heard Delhi belly stories before they came. 
And, all of a sudden, India was this land of opportunity. 
Cricketers all over the world said, "You know, we love India. We love to play in India." 
And that felt good, you know? 
We said, "The dollar's quite powerful actually." 
Can you imagine, you've got the dollar on view and there's no Delhi belly in there anymore. 
There's no filth, there's no beggars, all the snake charmers have vanished, everybody's gone. This tells you how the capitalist world rules. 
Right so, finally, an English game that India usurped a little bit, but T20 is going to be the next missionary in the world. 
If you want to take the game around the world, it's got to be the shortest form of the game. 
You can't take a timeless test to China and sit through 14 days with no result in the end, or you can't take it all over the world. 
So that's what T20 is doing. 
Hopefully, it'll make everyone richer, hopefully it'll make the game bigger and hopefully it'll give cricket commentators more time in the business. 
Thank you very much. Thank you. 
(Applause) 

I was here four years ago, and I remember, at the time, that the talks weren't put online. 
I think they were given to TEDsters in a box, a box set of DVDs, which they put on their shelves, where they are now. 
(Laughter) And actually, Chris called me a week after I'd given my talk, and said, "We're going to start putting them online. Can we put yours online?" 
And I said, "Sure." 
And four years later, it's been downloaded four million times. 
So I suppose you could multiply that by 20 or something to get the number of people who've seen it. 
And, as Chris says, there is a hunger for videos of me. 
(Laughter) (Applause) Don't you feel? 
(Laughter) So, this whole event has been an elaborate build-up to me doing another one for you, so here it is. 
(Laughter) Al Gore spoke at the TED conference I spoke at four years ago and talked about the climate crisis. 
And I referenced that at the end of my last talk. 
So I want to pick up from there because I only had 18 minutes, frankly. 
(Laughter) So, as I was saying -- (Laughter) You see, he's right. 
I mean, there is a major climate crisis, obviously, and I think if people don't believe it, they should get out more. 
(Laughter) But I believe there is a second climate crisis, which is as severe, which has the same origins, and that we have to deal with with the same urgency. 
And you may say, by the way, "Look, I'm good. 
I have one climate crisis, I don't really need the second one." 
(Laughter) But this is a crisis of, not natural resources -- though I believe that's true -- but a crisis of human resources. 
I believe fundamentally, as many speakers have said during the past few days, that we make very poor use of our talents. 
Very many people go through their whole lives having no real sense of what their talents may be, or if they have any to speak of. 
I meet all kinds of people who don't think they're really good at anything. 
Actually, I kind of divide the world into two groups now. 
Jeremy Bentham, the great utilitarian philosopher, once spiked this argument. 
He said, "There are two types of people in this world: those who divide the world into two types and those who do not." 
(Laughter) Well, I do. 
(Laughter) I meet all kinds of people who don't enjoy what they do. 
They simply go through their lives getting on with it. 
They get no great pleasure from what they do. 
They endure it rather than enjoy it, and wait for the weekend. 
But I also meet people who love what they do and couldn't imagine doing anything else. 
If you said, "Don't do this anymore," they'd wonder what you're talking about. 
It isn't what they do, it's who they are. 
They say, "But this is me, you know. 
It would be foolish to abandon this, because it speaks to my most authentic self." 
And it's not true of enough people. 
In fact, on the contrary, I think it's still true of a minority of people. 
And I think there are many possible explanations for it. 
And high among them is education, because education, in a way, dislocates very many people from their natural talents. 
And human resources are like natural resources; they're often buried deep. 
You have to go looking for them, they're not just lying around on the surface. 
You have to create the circumstances where they show themselves. 
And you might imagine education would be the way that happens, but too often, it's not. 
Every education system in the world is being reformed at the moment and it's not enough. 
Reform is no use anymore, because that's simply improving a broken model. 
What we need -- and the word's been used many times in the past few days -- is not evolution, but a revolution in education. 
This has to be transformed into something else. 
(Applause) One of the real challenges is to innovate fundamentally in education. 
Innovation is hard, because it means doing something that people don't find very easy, for the most part. 
It means challenging what we take for granted, things that we think are obvious. 
The great problem for reform or transformation is the tyranny of common sense. 
Things that people think, "It can't be done differently, that's how it's done." 
I came across a great quote recently from Abraham Lincoln, who I thought you'd be pleased to have quoted at this point. 
(Laughter) He said this in December 1862 to the second annual meeting of Congress. 
I ought to explain that I have no idea what was happening at the time. 
We don't teach American history in Britain. 
(Laughter) We suppress it. You know, this is our policy. 
(Laughter) No doubt, something fascinating was happening then, which the Americans among us will be aware of. 
But he said this: "The dogmas of the quiet past are inadequate to the stormy present. 
The occasion is piled high with difficulty, and we must rise with the occasion." 
I love that. 
Not rise to it, rise with it. 
"As our case is new, so we must think anew and act anew. 
We must disenthrall ourselves, and then we shall save our country." 
I love that word, "disenthrall." 
You know what it means? 
That there are ideas that all of us are enthralled to, which we simply take for granted as the natural order of things, the way things are. 
And many of our ideas have been formed, not to meet the circumstances of this century, but to cope with the circumstances of previous centuries. 
But our minds are still hypnotized by them, and we have to disenthrall ourselves of some of them. 
Now, doing this is easier said than done. 
It's very hard to know, by the way, what it is you take for granted. 
And the reason is that you take it for granted. 
(Laughter) Let me ask you something you may take for granted. 
How many of you here are over the age of 25? 
That's not what you take for granted, I'm sure you're familiar with that. 
Are there any people here under the age of 25? 
Great. Now, those over 25, could you put your hands up if you're wearing your wristwatch? 
Now that's a great deal of us, isn't it? 
Ask a room full of teenagers the same thing. 
Teenagers do not wear wristwatches. 
I don't mean they can't, they just often choose not to. 
And the reason is we were brought up in a pre-digital culture, those of us over 25. 
And so for us, if you want to know the time, you have to wear something to tell it. 
Kids now live in a world which is digitized, and the time, for them, is everywhere. 
They see no reason to do this. 
And by the way, you don't need either; it's just that you've always done it and you carry on doing it. 
My daughter never wears a watch, my daughter Kate, who's 20. 
She doesn't see the point. 
As she says, "It's a single-function device." 
(Laughter) "Like, how lame is that?" 
And I say, "No, no, it tells the date as well." 
(Laughter) "It has multiple functions." 
(Laughter) But, you see, there are things we're enthralled to in education. 
A couple of examples. 
One of them is the idea of linearity: that it starts here and you go through a track and if you do everything right, you will end up set for the rest of your life. 
Everybody who's spoken at TED has told us implicitly, or sometimes explicitly, a different story: that life is not linear; it's organic. 
We create our lives symbiotically as we explore our talents in relation to the circumstances they help to create for us. 
But, you know, we have become obsessed with this linear narrative. 
And probably the pinnacle for education is getting you to college. 
I think we are obsessed with getting people to college. 
Certain sorts of college. 
I don't mean you shouldn't go, but not everybody needs to go, or go now. 
Maybe they go later, not right away. 
And I was up in San Francisco a while ago doing a book signing. 
There was this guy buying a book, he was in his 30s. 
I said, "What do you do?" 
And he said, "I'm a fireman." 
I asked, "How long have you been a fireman?" 
"Always. I've always been a fireman." 
"Well, when did you decide?" He said, "As a kid. 
Actually, it was a problem for me at school, because at school, everybody wanted to be a fireman." 
(Laughter) He said, "But I wanted to be a fireman." 
And he said, "When I got to the senior year of school, my teachers didn't take it seriously. 
This one teacher didn't take it seriously. 
He said I was throwing my life away if that's all I chose to do with it; that I should go to college, I should become a professional person, that I had great potential and I was wasting my talent to do that." 
He said, "It was humiliating. 
It was in front of the whole class and I felt dreadful. 
But it's what I wanted, and as soon as I left school, I applied to the fire service and I was accepted. 
You know, I was thinking about that guy recently, just a few minutes ago when you were speaking, about this teacher, because six months ago, I saved his life." 
(Laughter) He said, "He was in a car wreck, and I pulled him out, gave him CPR, and I saved his wife's life as well." 
He said, "I think he thinks better of me now." 
(Laughter) (Applause) You know, to me, human communities depend upon a diversity of talent, not a singular conception of ability. 
And at the heart of our challenges -- (Applause) At the heart of the challenge is to reconstitute our sense of ability and of intelligence. 
This linearity thing is a problem. 
When I arrived in L.A. about nine years ago, I came across a policy statement -- very well-intentioned -- which said, "College begins in kindergarten." 
No, it doesn't. 
(Laughter) It doesn't. 
If we had time, I could go into this, but we don't. 
(Laughter) Kindergarten begins in kindergarten. 
(Laughter) A friend of mine once said, "A three year-old is not half a six year-old." 
(Laughter) (Applause) They're three. 
But as we just heard in this last session, there's such competition now to get into kindergarten -- to get to the right kindergarten -- that people are being interviewed for it at three. 
Kids sitting in front of unimpressed panels, you know, with their resumes -- (Laughter) Flicking through and saying, "What, this is it?" 
(Laughter) (Applause) "You've been around for 36 months, and this is it?" 
(Laughter) "You've achieved nothing -- commit. 
(Laughter) Spent the first six months breastfeeding, I can see." 
(Laughter) See, it's outrageous as a conception. 
The other big issue is conformity. 
We have built our education systems on the model of fast food. 
This is something Jamie Oliver talked about the other day. 
There are two models of quality assurance in catering. 
One is fast food, where everything is standardized. 
The other is like Zagat and Michelin restaurants, where everything is not standardized, they're customized to local circumstances. 
And we have sold ourselves into a fast-food model of education, and it's impoverishing our spirit and our energies as much as fast food is depleting our physical bodies. 
(Applause) We have to recognize a couple of things here. 
One is that human talent is tremendously diverse. 
People have very different aptitudes. 
I worked out recently that I was given a guitar as a kid at about the same time that Eric Clapton got his first guitar. 
(Laughter) It worked out for Eric, that's all I'm saying. 
(Laughter) In a way -- it did not for me. 
I could not get this thing to work no matter how often or how hard I blew into it. 
It just wouldn't work. 
(Laughter) But it's not only about that. 
It's about passion. 
Often, people are good at things they don't really care for. 
It's about passion, and what excites our spirit and our energy. 
And if you're doing the thing that you love to do, that you're good at, time takes a different course entirely. 
My wife's just finished writing a novel, and I think it's a great book, but she disappears for hours on end. 
You know this, if you're doing something you love, an hour feels like five minutes. 
If you're doing something that doesn't resonate with your spirit, five minutes feels like an hour. 
And the reason so many people are opting out of education is because it doesn't feed their spirit, it doesn't feed their energy or their passion. 
So I think we have to change metaphors. 
We have to go from what is essentially an industrial model of education, a manufacturing model, which is based on linearity and conformity and batching people. 
We have to move to a model that is based more on principles of agriculture. 
We have to recognize that human flourishing is not a mechanical process; it's an organic process. 
And you cannot predict the outcome of human development. 
All you can do, like a farmer, is create the conditions under which they will begin to flourish. 
So when we look at reforming education and transforming it, it isn't like cloning a system. 
There are great ones, like KIPP's; it's a great system. 
There are many great models. 
It's about customizing to your circumstances and personalizing education to the people you're actually teaching. 
And doing that, I think, is the answer to the future because it's not about scaling a new solution; it's about creating a movement in education in which people develop their own solutions, but with external support based on a personalized curriculum. 
Now in this room, there are people who represent extraordinary resources in business, in multimedia, in the Internet. 
These technologies, combined with the extraordinary talents of teachers, provide an opportunity to revolutionize education. 
And I urge you to get involved in it because it's vital, not just to ourselves, but to the future of our children. 
But we have to change from the industrial model to an agricultural model, where each school can be flourishing tomorrow. 
That's where children experience life. 
Or at home, if that's what they choose, to be educated with their families or friends. 
There's been a lot of talk about dreams over the course of these few days. 
And I wanted to just very quickly -- I was very struck by Natalie Merchant's songs last night, recovering old poems. 
I wanted to read you a quick, very short poem from W. B. Yeats, who some of you may know. 
He wrote this to his love, Maud Gonne, and he was bewailing the fact that he couldn't really give her what he thought she wanted from him. 
And he says, "I've got something else, but it may not be for you." 
He says this: "Had I the heavens' embroidered cloths, Enwrought with gold and silver light, The blue and the dim and the dark cloths Of night and light and the half-light, I would spread the cloths under your feet: But I, being poor, have only my dreams; I have spread my dreams under your feet; Tread softly because you tread on my dreams." 
And every day, everywhere, our children spread their dreams beneath our feet. 
And we should tread softly. 
Thank you. 
(Applause) Thank you very much. 
(Applause) Thank you. 
(Applause) 

A few years ago, I set out on a mission to find God. 
Now, I'm going to tell you right up front that I failed, which, as a lawyer, is a really hard thing for me to admit. 
But on that failed journey, a lot of what I found was enlightening. 
And one thing in particular gave me a lot of hope. 
It has to do with the magnitude and significance of our differences. 
So, I was raised in America by Indian parents -- culturally Hindu, but practicing a strict and relatively unknown religion outside of India called Jainism. 
To give you an idea of just how minority that makes me: people from India represent roughly one percent of the US population; Hindus, about 0.7 percent; Jains, at most .00046 percent. 
To put that in context: more people visit the Vermont Teddy Bear Factory each year than are followers of the Jain religion in America. 
To add to my minority mix, my parents then decided, "What a great idea! Let's send her to Catholic school" -- (Laughter) where my sister and I were the only non-white, non-Catholic students in the entire school. 
At the Infant Jesus of Prague School in Flossmoor, Illinois -- yes, that's really what it was called -- we were taught to believe that there is a single Supreme Being who is responsible for everything, the whole shebang, from the creation of the Universe to moral shepherding to eternal life. 
But at home, I was being taught something entirely different. 
Followers of the Jain religion don't believe in a single Supreme Being or even a team of Supreme Beings. 
Instead, we're taught that God manifests as the perfection of each of us as individuals, and that we're actually spending our entire lives striving to remove the bad karmas that stand in the way of us becoming our own godlike, perfect selves. 
On top of that, one of the core principles of Jainism is something called "non-absolutism." 
Non-absolutists believe that no single person can hold ownership or knowledge of absolute truth, even when it comes to religious beliefs. 
Good luck testing that concept out on the priests and nuns in your Catholic school. 
(Laughter) No wonder I was confused and hyperaware of how different I was from my peers. 
Cut to 20-something years later, and I found myself to be a highly spiritual person, but I was floundering. 
I was spiritually homeless. 
I came to learn that I was a "None," which isn't an acronym or a clever play on words, nor is it one of these. 
It's simply the painfully uninspired name given to everyone who checks off the box "none" when Pew Research asks them about their religious affiliation. 
(Laughter) Now, a couple of interesting things about Nones are: there are a lot of us, and we skew young. 
In 2014, there were over 56 million religiously unaffiliated Nones in the United States. 
And Nones account for over one-third of adults between the ages of 18 to 33. 
But the most interesting thing to me about Nones is that we're often spiritual. 
In fact, 68 percent of us believe, with some degree of certainty, that there is a God. 
We're just not sure who it is. 
(Laughter) So the first takeaway for me when I realized I was a None and had found that information out was that I wasn't alone. 
I was finally part of a group in America that had a lot of members, which felt really reassuring. 
But then the second, not-so-reassuring takeaway was that, oh, man, there are a lot of us. 
That can't be good, because if a lot of highly spiritual people are currently godless, maybe finding God is not going to be as easy as I had originally hoped. 
So that is when I decided that on my spiritual journey, I was going to avoid the obvious places and skip the big-box religions altogether and instead venture out into the spiritual fringe of mediums and faith healers and godmen. 
But remember, I'm a non-absolutist, which means I was pretty inclined to keep a fairly open mind, which turned out to be a good thing, because I went to a witch's potluck dinner at the LGBT Center in New York City, where I befriended two witches; drank a five-gallon jerrican full of volcanic water with a shaman in Peru; got a hug from a saint in the convention center -- she smelled really nice -- (Laughter) chanted for hours in a smoke-filled, heat-infused sweat lodge on the beaches of Mexico; worked with a tequila-drinking medium to convene with the dead, who oddly included both my deceased mother-in-law and the deceased manager of the hip-hop group The Roots. 
(Laughter) Yeah, my mother-in-law told me she was really happy her son had chosen me for his wife. 
Duh! But -- (Laughter) Yeah. 
But the manager of The Roots said that maybe I should cut back on all the pasta I was eating. 
I think we can all agree that it was lucky for my husband that it wasn't his dead mother who suggested I lay off carbs. 
(Laughter) I also joined a laughing yoga group out of South Africa; witnessed a woman have a 45-minute orgasm -- I am not making this up -- as she tapped into the energy of the universe -- I think I'm going to go back there -- (Laughter) called God from a phone booth in the Nevada desert at Burning Man, wearing a unitard and ski goggles; and I had an old Indian guy lie on top of me, and no, he wasn't my husband. 
This was a perfect stranger named Paramji, and he was chanting into my chakras as he tapped into the energy forces of the Universe to heal my "yoni," which is a Sanskrit word for "vagina." 
(Laughter) I was going to have a slide here, but a few people suggested that a slide of my yoni at TED -- even TEDWomen -- not the best idea. 
(Laughter) Very early in my quest, I also went to see the Brazilian faith healer John of God at his compound down in Brazil. 
Now, John of God is considered a full-trance medium, which basically means he can talk to dead people. 
But in his case, he claims to channel a very specific group of dead saints and doctors in order to heal whatever's wrong with you. 
And although John of God does not have a medical degree or even a high school diploma, he actually performs surgery -- the real kind, with a scalpel, but no anesthesia. 
Yeah, I don't know. 
He also offers invisible surgery, where there is no cutting, and surrogate surgery, where he supposedly can treat somebody who is thousands of miles away by performing a procedure on a loved one. 
Now, when you go to visit John of God, there are all kinds of rules and regulations. 
It's a whole complicated thing, but the bottom line is that you can visit John of God and present him with three things that you would like fixed, and he will set the dead saints and doctors to work on your behalf to get the job done. 
(Laughter) Now, before you snicker, consider that, at least according to his website, over eight million people -- including Oprah, the Goddess of Daytime TV -- have gone to see John of God, and I was pre-wired to keep an open mind. 
But to be honest, the whole thing for me was kind of weird and inconclusive, and in the end, I flew home, even more confused than I already started out. 
But that doesn't mean I came home empty-handed. 
In the weeks leading up to my trip to Brazil, I mentioned my upcoming plans to some friends and to a couple of colleagues at Google, where I was a lawyer at the time. 
And I might have mentioned it to a couple more people because I'm chatty, including my neighbor, the guy who works at the local coffee shop I go to each morning, the checkout lady at Whole Foods and a stranger who sat next to me on the subway. 
I told each of them where I was going and why, and I offered to carry three wishes of theirs down to Brazil, explaining that anyone going to see John of God could act as a proxy for others and save them the trip. 
And to my surprise, my in-box overflowed. 
Friends told friends who told friends, and those friends apparently told more friends, other strangers and the guys at their coffee shops, until it seemed that days before I left for Brazil that there was no one who did not have my email address. 
And at the time, all I could conclude was that I had offered too much to too many. 
But when I actually reread those messages a few years later, I noticed something completely different. 
Those emails actually shared three commonalities, the first of which was rather curious. 
Almost everyone sent me meticulous details about how they could be reached. 
I had told them, or their friends had told them, that along with the list of the three things they wanted fixed, I needed their photo, their name and their date of birth. 
But they gave me full addresses, with, like, apartment numbers and zip codes, as if John of God was going to stop by their house and see them in person or send along a package. 
It was as if, in the highly unlikely event that their wishes were granted by John of God, they just wanted to make sure that they weren't delivered to the wrong person or the wrong address. 
Even if they didn't believe, they were hedging their bets. 
The second commonality was just as curious, but far more humbling. 
Virtually everyone -- the stranger on the subway, the guy at the coffee shop, the lawyer down the hall, the Jew, the atheist, the Muslim, the devout Catholic -- all asked for essentially the same three things. 
OK, there were a couple of outliers, and yes, a few people asked for cash. 
But when I eliminated what were ultimately a handful of anomalies, the similarities were staggering. 
Almost every single person first asked for good health for themselves and their families. 
Almost universally, they next asked for happiness and then love, in that order: health, happiness, love. 
Sometimes they asked for a specific health issue to be fixed, but more often than not, they just asked for good health in general. 
When it came to happiness, they each phrased it slightly differently, but they all asked for the same specific subtype of happiness, too -- the kind of happiness that sinks in and sets down roots in your soul; the kind of happiness that could sustain us, even if we were to lose absolutely everything else. 
And for love, they all asked for the kind of romantic love, the soul mate that we read about in epic romantic novels, the kind of love that will stay with us till the end of our days. 
Sorry, that's my husband. 
Crap! Now I forgot my place. 
(Laughter) (Applause) So by and large, all of these friends and strangers, regardless of their background, race or religion, all asked for the same things, and they were the same things that I really wanted, the simplified version of the basic human needs identified by social scientists like Abraham Maslow and Manfred Max-Neef. 
No one asked for answers to the big existential questions or for proof of God or the meaning of life like I had set out to find. 
They didn't even ask for an end to war or global hunger. 
Even when they could have asked for absolutely anything, they all asked for health, happiness and love. 
So now those emails had a third commonality as well. 
Each of them ended in the exact same way. 
Instead of thanking me for carting their wishes all the way to Brazil, everyone said, "Please don't tell anyone." 
So I decided to tell everyone -- (Laughter) right here on this stage, not because I'm untrustworthy, but because the fact that we have so much in common feels especially important for us all to hear, especially now, when so many of the world's problems seem to be because we keep focusing on the things that make us different, not on what binds us together. 
And look -- I am the first to admit that I am not a statistician, and that the data I presented to you that I just accumulated in my in-box is more anecdotal than scientific, more qualitative than quantitative. 
It is, as anyone who works with data would tell you, hardly a statistically significant or demographically balanced sample. 
But nonetheless, I find myself thinking about those emails every time I reflect back on the bias and prejudice that I've faced in my life, or when there's another hate crime or a senseless tragedy that underscores the disheartening sense that our differences might be insurmountable. 
I then remind myself that I have evidence that the humbling, unifying commonality of our humanity is that, even when presented with the opportunity to ask for anything at all, most of us want the same things, and that this is true no matter who we are, what name we call our god, or which religion, if any, we call home. 
I then also note that apparently some of us want these things so badly that we would email a None, a spiritually confused None like me -- some might say otherwise confused as well -- and that we would seek out this stranger and email her our deepest wishes, just in case there is the remote possibility that they might be granted by someone who is not a god, much less our god, someone who is not even a member of our chosen religion, someone who, when you look at him on paper, seems like an unlikely candidate to deliver. 
And so now, when I reflect back on my spiritual quest, even though I did not find God, I found a home in this: even today, in a world fractured by religious, ethnic, political, philosophical, and racial divides, even with all of our obvious differences, at the end of the day, and the most fundamental level, we are all the same. 
Thank you. 
(Applause) 

Hello, everyone. 
Sawubona. 
In South Africa, where I come from, "sawubona" is the Zulu word for "hello." 
There's a beautiful and powerful intention behind the word because "sawubona" literally translated means, "I see you, and by seeing you, I bring you into being." 
So beautiful, imagine being greeted like that. 
But what does it take in the way we see ourselves? 
Our thoughts, our emotions and our stories that help us to thrive in an increasingly complex and fraught world? 
This crucial question has been at the center of my life's work. 
Because how we deal with our inner world drives everything. 
Every aspect of how we love, how we live, how we parent and how we lead. 
The conventional view of emotions as good or bad, positive or negative, is rigid. 
And rigidity in the face of complexity is toxic. 
We need greater levels of emotional agility for true resilience and thriving. 
My journey with this calling began not in the hallowed halls of a university, but in the messy, tender business of life. 
I grew up in the white suburbs of apartheid South Africa, a country and community committed to not seeing. 
To denial. 
It's denial that makes 50 years of racist legislation possible while people convince themselves that they are doing nothing wrong. 
And yet, I first learned of the destructive power of denial at a personal level, before I understood what it was doing to the country of my birth. 
My father died on a Friday. 
He was 42 years old and I was 15. 
My mother whispered to me to go and say goodbye to my father before I went to school. 
So I put my backpack down and walked the passage that ran through to where the heart of our home my father lay dying of cancer. 
His eyes were closed, but he knew I was there. 
In his presence, I had always felt seen. 
I told him I loved him, said goodbye and headed off for my day. 
At school, I drifted from science to mathematics to history to biology, as my father slipped from the world. 
From May to July to September to November, I went about with my usual smile. 
I didn't drop a single grade. 
When asked how I was doing, I would shrug and say, "OK." 
I was praised for being strong. 
I was the master of being OK. 
But back home, we struggled -- my father hadn't been able to keep his small business going during his illness. 
And my mother, alone, was grieving the love of her life trying to raise three children, and the creditors were knocking. 
We felt, as a family, financially and emotionally ravaged. 
And I began to spiral down, isolated, fast. 
I started to use food to numb my pain. 
Binging and purging. 
Refusing to accept the full weight of my grief. 
No one knew, and in a culture that values relentless positivity, I thought that no one wanted to know. 
But one person did not buy into my story of triumph over grief. 
My eighth-grade English teacher fixed me with burning blue eyes as she handed out blank notebooks. 
She said, "Write what you're feeling. 
Tell the truth. 
Write like nobody's reading." 
And just like that, I was invited to show up authentically to my grief and pain. 
It was a simple act but nothing short of a revolution for me. 
It was this revolution that started in this blank notebook 30 years ago that shaped my life's work. 
The secret, silent correspondence with myself. 
Like a gymnast, I started to move beyond the rigidity of denial into what I've now come to call emotional agility. 
Life's beauty is inseparable from its fragility. 
We are young until we are not. 
We walk down the streets sexy until one day we realize that we are unseen. 
We nag our children and one day realize that there is silence where that child once was, now making his or her way in the world. 
We are healthy until a diagnosis brings us to our knees. 
The only certainty is uncertainty, and yet we are not navigating this frailty successfully or sustainably. 
The World Health Organization tells us that depression is now the single leading cause of disability globally -- outstripping cancer, outstripping heart disease. 
And at a time of greater complexity, unprecedented technological, political and economic change, we are seeing how people's tendency is more and more to lock down into rigid responses to their emotions. 
On the one hand we might obsessively brood on our feelings. 
Getting stuck inside our heads. 
Hooked on being right. 
Or victimized by our news feed. 
On the other, we might bottle our emotions, pushing them aside and permitting only those emotions deemed legitimate. 
In a survey I recently conducted with over 70,000 people, I found that a third of us -- a third -- either judge ourselves for having so-called "bad emotions," like sadness, anger or even grief. 
Or actively try to push aside these feelings. 
We do this not only to ourselves, but also to people we love, like our children -- we may inadvertently shame them out of emotions seen as negative, jump to a solution, and fail to help them to see these emotions as inherently valuable. 
Normal, natural emotions are now seen as good or bad. 
And being positive has become a new form of moral correctness. 
People with cancer are automatically told to just stay positive. 
Women, to stop being so angry. 
And the list goes on. 
It's a tyranny. 
It's a tyranny of positivity. 
And it's cruel. 
Unkind. 
And ineffective. 
And we do it to ourselves, and we do it to others. 
If there's one common feature of brooding, bottling or false positivity, it's this: they are all rigid responses. 
And if there's a single lesson we can learn from the inevitable fall of apartheid it is that rigid denial doesn't work. 
It's unsustainable. 
For individuals, for families, for societies. 
And as we watch the ice caps melt, it is unsustainable for our planet. 
Research on emotional suppression shows that when emotions are pushed aside or ignored, they get stronger. 
Psychologists call this amplification. 
Like that delicious chocolate cake in the refrigerator -- the more you try to ignore it ... 
(Laughter) the greater its hold on you. 
You might think you're in control of unwanted emotions when you ignore them, but in fact they control you. 
Internal pain always comes out. 
Always. 
And who pays the price? 
We do. 
Our children, our colleagues, our communities. 
Now, don't get me wrong. 
I'm not anti-happiness. 
I like being happy. 
I'm a pretty happy person. 
But when we push aside normal emotions to embrace false positivity, we lose our capacity to develop skills to deal with the world as it is, not as we wish it to be. 
I've had hundreds of people tell me what they don't want to feel. 
They say things like, "I don't want to try because I don't want to feel disappointed." 
Or, "I just want this feeling to go away." 
"I understand," I say to them. 
"But you have dead people's goals." 
(Laughter) (Applause) Only dead people never get unwanted or inconvenienced by their feelings. 
(Laughter) Only dead people never get stressed, never get broken hearts, never experience the disappointment that comes with failure. 
Tough emotions are part of our contract with life. 
You don't get to have a meaningful career or raise a family or leave the world a better place without stress and discomfort. 
Discomfort is the price of admission to a meaningful life. 
So, how do we begin to dismantle rigidity and embrace emotional agility? 
As that young schoolgirl, when I leaned into those blank pages, I started to do away with feelings of what I should be experiencing. 
And instead started to open my heart to what I did feel. 
Pain. 
And grief. 
And loss. 
And regret. 
Research now shows that the radical acceptance of all of our emotions -- even the messy, difficult ones -- is the cornerstone to resilience, thriving, and true, authentic happiness. 
But emotional agility is more that just an acceptance of emotions. 
We also know that accuracy matters. 
In my own research, I found that words are essential. 
We often use quick and easy labels to describe our feelings. 
"I'm stressed" is the most common one I hear. 
But there's a world of difference between stress and disappointment or stress and that knowing dread of "I'm in the wrong career." 
When we label our emotions accurately, we are more able to discern the precise cause of our feelings. 
And what scientists call the readiness potential in our brain is activated, allowing us to take concrete steps. 
But not just any steps -- the right steps for us. 
Because our emotions are data. 
Our emotions contain flashing lights to things that we care about. 
We tend not to feel strong emotion to stuff that doesn't mean anything in our worlds. 
If you feel rage when you read the news, that rage is a signpost, perhaps, that you value equity and fairness -- and an opportunity to take active steps to shape your life in that direction. 
When we are open to the difficult emotions, we are able to generate responses that are values-aligned. 
But there's an important caveat. 
Emotions are data, they are not directives. 
We can show up to and mine our emotions for their values without needing to listen to them. 
Just like I can show up to my son in his frustration with his baby sister -- but not endorse his idea that he gets to give her away to the first stranger he sees in a shopping mall. 
(Laughter) We own our emotions, they don't own us. 
When we internalize the difference between how I feel in all my wisdom and what I do in a values-aligned action, we generate the pathway to our best selves via our emotions. 
So, what does this look like in practice? 
When you feel a strong, tough emotion, don't race for the emotional exits. 
Learn its contours, show up to the journal of your hearts. 
What is the emotion telling you? 
And try not to say "I am," as in, "I'm angry" or "I'm sad." 
When you say "I am" it makes you sound as if you are the emotion. 
Whereas you are you, and the emotion is a data source. 
Instead, try to notice the feeling for what it is: "I'm noticing that I'm feeling sad" or "I'm noticing that I'm feeling angry." 
These are essential skills for us, our families, our communities. 
They're also critical to the workplace. 
In my research, when I looked at what helps people to bring the best of themselves to work, I found a powerful key contributor: individualized consideration. 
When people are allowed to feel their emotional truth, engagement, creativity and innovation flourish in the organization. 
Diversity isn't just people, it's also what's inside people. 
Including diversity of emotion. 
The most agile, resilient individuals, teams, organizations, families, communities are built on an openness to the normal human emotions. 
It's this that allows us to say, "What is my emotion telling me?" 
"Which action will bring me towards my values?" 
"Which will take me away from my values?" 
Emotional agility is the ability to be with your emotions with curiosity, compassion, and especially the courage to take values-connected steps. 
When I was little, I would wake up at night terrified by the idea of death. 
My father would comfort me with soft pats and kisses. 
But he would never lie. 
"We all die, Susie," he would say. 
"It's normal to be scared." 
He didn't try to invent a buffer between me and reality. 
It took me a while to understand the power of how he guided me through those nights. 
What he showed me is that courage is not an absence of fear; courage is fear walking. 
Neither of us knew that in 10 short years, he would be gone. 
And that time for each of us is all too precious and all too brief. 
But when our moment comes to face our fragility, in that ultimate time, it will ask us, "Are you agile?" 
"Are you agile?" 
Let the moment be an unreserved "yes." 
A "yes" born of a lifelong correspondence with your own heart. 
And in seeing yourself. 
Because in seeing yourself, you are also able to see others, too: the only sustainable way forward in a fragile, beautiful world. 
Sawubona. 
And thank you. 
(Laughter) Thank you. 
(Applause) Thank you. 
(Applause)
