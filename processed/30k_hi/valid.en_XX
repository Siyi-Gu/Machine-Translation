right i mean the turks would love to have only 10000 syrian refugees
so dearth of data in the debate is one reason
they want more space and more voice so that they can gather to help each other
i was born in a refugee colony in the capital city of india new delhi
because we know that whatever comes in through those er double doors that we can handle it

so was it possible their telomeres were worn down as well
all other animals live in an objective reality

this one teacher didnt take it seriously
there are no emergency meetings no headlines no breaking news
everything i said took a new meaning
then half of them announced their commitment to this goal to the room and half didnt
nhh alright dr tompkins lets get started
and i regretted the time i wasted on things that did not matter with people that matter

at free america weve done a listening and learning tour
great creativity can make politicians electable or parties unelectable
i felt the weight of stigma
our president declared a state of emergency in august and suspended certain rights
