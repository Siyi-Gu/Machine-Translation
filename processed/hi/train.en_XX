now to explain how this works i want you all to pretend that you are participants in a study designed to stress you out
and that moment is right now and those moments are counting down and those moments are always always always fleeting
secondly you dry the water hyacinth stems
and sometimes through the muck of the internet you get to find a kindred spirit

al gore knows its basically everything
over on the other side we have the skin community in blue the vaginal community in purple and then right down at the bottom we have the fecal community in brown

opossum check living yep
people are hurting and suffering
  i assure you people have done much more careful calculations and it comes out with the same answer which is that you have to put chalk up at the rate of about 10 teragrams a year to undo the effects of the co2 that weve already done  just in terms of temperature not all the effects but the temperature
other people though thought photographs like these best reflect how obama really looks

tequila friday
and look at this
believe it or not we actually buy family plans   for this fleet of vehicles because thats how we get the best rates
chris anderson reshma thank you
and about halfway through this project i defined sonder the idea that we all think of ourselves as the main character and everyone else is just extras
 these artifacts and designs are inspiring
but im going to tell you exactly what it means on the ground for someone like me
thank you very much
in 1930 this country went through a great depression which led to all the ideas of the state and social security and all the other things that happened in roosevelts time
so having experimented in all sorts of remote places i came to the most remote place that i could think of
these are the top 250 grossing fire hydrants in terms of parking tickets
now think of the large and small plagues that we have now  bed bugs killer bees spam  and its very possible that the solutions to those will really extend well beyond the immediate question
yeah and then a swedish guy showed me my room
in hospitals there theres a community of nurses physicians and scientists that have been quietly battling one of the deadliest threats to humanity for years lassa virus
also we can monitor the growth of this forest without being on site
i know a man who would rather die than tell another man that theyre hurting
and today we have what is perhaps our most offensive definition at least to me which is the following to doodle officially means to dawdle to dilly dally to monkey around to make meaningless marks to do something of little value substance or import and  my personal favorite  to do nothing
but before i show you what ive got inside im going to make a very public confession and that is im outfitobsessed

you can go 15 minutes or 30 minutes or 45 minutes or an hour
i jump out next to her going dont you move
no i wrote it in a month
and while you have affordability youve lost on functionality
 i knew if i had to do something different i would have to stay in school
ive traveled north to the arctic to the capture the unfolding story of polar melt and south to the equator to document the subsequent rising seas

so i say perdon yo no hablo ingles well wouldnt you know he had been in honduras for the peace corps
maybe a pet died

it took weeks before i could admit it but the doctor was right i was depressed
and so you can do that in mice and you can do it in monkeys because you can physically put things into their brain but for some reason we still cant do that in humans ok

have you ever broken something in real life and then found yourself looking for an undo button in real life
it can tell you that the woman is smiling
even formerly enslaved african children in the antebellum south jumped rope too
what i got is basically a gestureinterface device that actually acts as a motionsensing device made for two dollars
now why are these good objectives

as an example china is in the process of rolling out a social credit rating that will cover its entire population rewarding and restricting citizens based on highly qualitative characteristics like honesty and integrity
and thats why i believe that if you live your life with a great attitude choosing to move forward and move on whenever life deals you a blow living with a sense of awareness of the world around you embracing your inner three yearold and seeing the tiny joys that make life so sweet and being authentic to yourself being you and being cool with that letting your heart lead you and putting yourself in experiences that satisfy you then i think youll live a life that is rich and is satisfying and i think youll live a life that is truly awesome

he refuses the sacred cactus and sets off toward the mountains
i have looked at the best and ive looked at some of the worst
sustained abundance of good food enabled a healthier population to boom economically
how should we make the rules that govern us
you were like what the hell is she talking about
so these planes have sim cards just like your cell phone does and theyre communicating over the cell network to tell us where they are and how theyre doing at all times
and when i met them and i saw their work i decided i wanted to help
so if effective practice is the key how can we get the most out of our practice time
and the thing i want you to look at here is the telescope on the righthand side
karachi pakistan
so we cant relate to her and when you cant relate to somebody you dont envy them
and if he says well what how

we know that a million and a half children die a year from diarrhea and a lot of it is because of open defecation
ca there isnt ill tell you what
we noticed that some mothers despite having been carefully caring for their children for many years had been able to maintain their telomeres
we call this key exchange
now i have these learnings these secrets from all different multiplication tables
and it was a turning point
then 50 percent goes in their house account 50 percent in their toy account
and as im speaking to you today there are 63 inmates and staff in the kenya prison service studying law at the university of london through distance learning
in other words not an autocracy in which i would lead and others would follow and not a democracy in which everybodys points of view were equally valued but i wanted to have an idea meritocracy in which the best ideas would win out
i also learned how the most uncontrollable form of energy could be harnessed for good and making society better
and if you have more consideration for others you are not going to ransack that planet that we have and at the current rate we dont have three planets to continue that way
and its a very dangerous question because it leads you to the path of fundamentalism and violence
let me tell you a stunning statistic
i am so lucky that im working with these women
and of course that crowd is growing all the time because every week every month more people will keep downloading and keep watching
i watched over 15 hours all these people not even look at sacrécoeur
no one has been successful deploying a huge constellation for internet broadband or basically for satellite internet and i dont think physics is the difficulty here
most of the places i went to i decided to go there because ive heard about it through the media
and later i can find a wall anywhere and start browsing those photos or maybe ok i want to modify this photo a little bit and send it as an email to a friend
my aim is to give a voice to the silent people to show the hidden lights behind the curtain of the great game the small worlds ignored by the media and the prophets of a global conflict
let me give you a small example
it quickly became the most emailed article on the site
then our neighbor pops her head in and she turns red with rage when she realizes that those immigrants from downstairs have somehow gotten their hands on her pizza
we realized that the most convenient way to highlight the presence of the probiotics and hence the presence of the tumors was to get these bacteria to produce a signal that would be detectable in the urine and so we specifically programmed these probiotics to make a molecule that would change the color of your urine to indicate the presence of cancer
boris yeltsin starts to laugh and he is laughing primarily here through pure contagion
but you dont cross it once
also people like myself were fighting two battles on different grounds
and the average facebook user is creating 90 pieces of content each month
i like to move beyond raising awareness
the only thing that trickled down from reaganomics was ghettonomics pain prison and poverty
well its more that youve played on a treadmill
i had to step down
it turns out whatever physical activity is not taking a lot of attention
and so you have to understand that i have a bachelors and a masters in social work and i was getting my phd in social work so my entire academic career was surrounded by people who kind of believed in the lifes messy love it
and what they want is not to have to do that
thats the process by which organisms that best fit an environment survive and get to reproduce while those that are less fit slowly die off
 she took our order and then went to the couple in the booth next to us and she lowered her voice so much i had to really strain to hear what she was saying
we were taken into a slum in the outskirts of manila
this does not have any sensors so its an openloop control
when you really think about it were sort of just like bags of fluids and some weird tissues surrounded by a thin layer of skin
but in 1492 two important things happen
 so babe thumbs up to you too
in fact they go 15 feet deep and collect rain water from roof there is a small pipe and from their courtyard
many of them are quexo’s friends from festivals over the years but he doesn’t see the mountain shamans who would have cinnabar
so our theory is that eventually we should be doing this with homes
it was a new thing for us we had only ever supported our country  the only two areas in which india was very proud about their country representing itself on the field
at the biology and the built environment center we carried out a study in a hospital where we sampled air and pulled the dna out of microbes in the air
remember those three things important for encryption  highquality keys secure key exchange and a strong algorithm
and i asked myself why
listen i want to make it clear that im a very fortunate person
and we do not ask this question
he doesnt remember if he stole my chocolate bar but he remembers the year of release for every song on my ipod conversations we had when he was four weeing on my arm on the first ever episode of teletubbies and lady gagas birthday
we all know that clean energy products technologies tend to be characterized by higher upfront costs but very low operating costs
this is a nationwide policy agenda im trying to build and as you all know politics are personal
except he didnt use the word funk
and many of you are excited about the nextgeneration tablet computers to come out in the market
youre on the field with your folks
when this happened to me 17 years ago there was no name for it
ive learned to respect the lightning
well what we see is actually pretty ugly
athletes for instance have a naturally higher bmi
and as we redesign work for an era of intelligent machines i invite you all to work alongside me to bring more humanity to our working lives
but the important thing about that video and the insights we have for every second of every nba game  its not that
how would you feel
and as we get older diseases such as alzheimers and others may develop
and you cant isolate just the difficult feelings so i lost access to the joy the pleasure the play and i spent decades like that with this his lowgrade depression thinking that this is what it meant to be a grownup
i saw my mother and elderly women were crying and they were pleading to these elderly people because they had threatened to outcaste my whole family
then i dont look it but i was the indian national squash champion for three years
and there she was standing in my lab which ironically overlooked the entrance to a mortuary and   and she had a lifeanddeath question for me
ok now lets look at these three portraits
this is bleak house by dickens
thank you
and its not just my friends and i who experience this
but what are human rights
i have to tell you that agreeing on our common yes across such diversity of experiences and against a backdrop of a lot of painful history was not easy work
you have to show that you have a skill that you can offer to the community and provide a service to the community
greenpeace came back to the site and thanked reddit for its participation
but resettlement and longterm integration options are often limited
so we conducted studies where five participants would witness an experimenter act rudely to someone who arrived late to the study
you could even use the lime to add it directly to seawater to counteract ocean acidification one of the other issues that is caused by co2 in the atmosphere
if you look out on the eight million species that we share this planet with think of them all being four billion years of evolution
its very difficult for a foreign university to come to india
but this will produce an equally massive amount of desalination brine
somebody trained them to do the work that they do
indeed it promotes empathy and generosity
and so despite concerted efforts in agriculture to make crops with improved properties of resistance avoidance and tolerance  particularly resistance and avoidance because weve had good models to understand how those work  we still get images like this
china does want to do more leadership
especially here in washington if you try to make a breakfast date and you say how about eight oclock
and yeah it is also why we get things wrong
and doing that i think is the answer to the future because its not about scaling a new solution its about creating a movement in education in which people develop their own solutions but with external support based on a personalized curriculum
i cant define where i begin and where i end because the atoms and the molecules of my arm blended with the atoms and molecules of the wall
i think its excessive internet use in general excessive video gaming excessive new access to pornography
so we started out small
and just minutes later i was playing dead underneath a table next to a pool of blood
so how do you construct belief
we falsely accused teens and adults of cheating on a study task  an academic dishonesty offense  that we told them was as serious as cheating in a class
the us government spends 10 times more every year on cancer research than on alzheimers despite the fact that alzheimers costs us more and causes a similar number of deaths each year as cancer
but we are not going to decrease meat consumption unless we give consumers alternatives that cost the same or less and that taste the same or better
over and well over three million people have crossed the borders and have found sanctuary in the neighboring countries and only a small proportion as you see have moved on to europe
that took three and a half months
i think theres two ways to resolve this paradox
this region seen here for the first time in the cassini image taken in 2005 this is the south polar region with the famous tigerstripe fractures crossing the south pole
this galaxy doesnt just have an outer ring it has an additional diffused inner ring
even empathy from one person can make a difference

so farai had six sessions on the bench with grandmother jack
in the netherlands and in denmark weve seen very good successes in cancer clinics organizing chemotherapies at the patients homes sometimes even together with fellow patients
it started when i was 10 years old and my mother who was raising six children had no time for them
 today ebola has come under control in west africa and weve learned a few things
what does this compassion entail
but what i didnt understand was that i am not alone in this

 people who experienced a lot of stress but did not view stress as harmful were no more likely to die
for the first one the anesthesia bill alone was 2000 dollars the second one 2000 dollars the third one 6000 dollars
so not only that we have given advice that has changed strategies that have helped teams win very important games and its very exciting because you have coaches whove been in the league for 30 years that are willing to take advice from a machine
and it was very obvious that if we destroy these silent places on earth we will be stuck on a planet without the ability to look outwards because we will not be able to understand the signals that come from outer space
and thats all very true
we have to start collecting from 555
thank you guys thank you
and in studies weve just been doing in my lab similar studies weve show that four yearolds are actually better at finding out an unlikely hypothesis than adults are when we give them exactly the same task
she said i want to save because i want to buy a plastic sheet before the monsoons arrive
we tend to think of energy use as a behavioral thing  i choose to turn this light switch on  but really enormous amounts of our energy use are predestined by the kinds of communities and cities that we live in
in a recent mimicking study at the university of clermontferrand in france subjects were asked to determine whether a smile was real or fake while holding a pencil in their mouth to repress smiling muscles
so who are we
almost everyone lived on or around the poverty line
have a moratorium  we shouldnt have any new coalfired generating plants that arent able to capture and store co2 which means we have to quickly build these renewable sources
i couldnt be controlling the paint like i used to
this is one way to do it
to accomplish this task the emperor enlisted soldiers and commoners not always voluntarily
we find tens of thousands even hundreds of thousands
and when kids came in to play this game they loved seeing themselves onscreen with wings
i think that we must help others see what we see
dust from that factory covers ravis mustache and everything he wears
and so i began my quest to find out how i can learn how to weave
whether or not you stir the fluids remain in a mixture but in its final move the quantum computer can unmix the zero and one perfectly recovering heads so that you lose every time
so at 23 billion dollars before the first ball was bowled
heres the stratosphere cooler
when i married my wife i promised her i would listen to her every day as if for the first time
we experience it anytime someone assumes were too old for something instead of finding out who we are and what were capable of or too young
humans have lived for much much longer than the approximately 10000 years of settled agricultural civilization in small family groups nomadic hunters bring down rabbits gathering food
we got behind it ourselves we changed our logo for the day from the alien to splashy to help the cause
thanks
its what gives purpose and meaning to our lives
they viewed the people they sold not as fellow africans but criminals debtors or prisoners of war from rival tribes
so i am an optimist about our future selves but im not an optimist because i think our problems are small
so how do we create more medical device success stories from africa
and in the three years that i was finance minister they made an average of 360 million dollars profit per year
and its not only what you eat but its also the texture of the food when you eat it and how much of it you eat
i always live in the present  i love the present
well who was inspired during that time period
 the worth should be about 25 million
 how can we lend and borrow more things without knocking on each others doors at a bad time
but then and only then can we actually address and confront this legacy of slavery and dismantle this ugly legacy of slavery
and society is never the same
what i found is that in the smallpox eradication programme people of all colors all religions all races so many countries came together
you had to go to class
because we know that whatever comes in through those er double doors that we can handle it
so i believe primary education is an idea which is arrived but not yet implemented
step one to go from crazy mode to ready mode is to relentlessly triage
and i took my bike into the bike store i love this  same bike and theyd do something called truing the wheels
one thing is you know youll be hearing from a guy in the next session who said some time ago that he could sequence the human genome in half no time and everyone said well its obviously impossible
im thrilled that we now have a completely new weapon and i should say an inexpensive weapon in our fight against superbugs
at least good work hopefully at least its good work  hopefully great work
we havent begun to scratch the surface of what travel could be because we havent looked at what religions do with travel
he was taking pictures of me and of my sketches and i thought this is great a vietnamese fan
what would that money be used for that they charge the extra for
because you know there are eight people shouting at the same time
and that is the translation of the feelings that we may have about compassion into the wider world into action
how can we disengage or unhook ourselves from the horns of the amygdala
but we could unpack this and see how the countries are doing
and the experience of loneliness turns out to be toxic
i truly believe its where dignity starts
so my question is if it can be done in europe why not in the middle east
maybe its what the cia is supposed to do for us
they dont have the constantly fluctuating levels of hormones that could disrupt clean data they could get if they had only men
  tutti frutti
but i wanted to reach out to you and say i understand that you disagree with me and im going to take my lumps on this one
and we stand up and we speak up and we tell the world what happened to us
find your reason
instead of exploring outer space i wanted to explore the wonders of inner space
or maybe youve read an article or a study that examined some controversial policy like capital punishment
and i became a learner because i found myself in a community of learners
my personality was entombed within a seemingly silent body a vibrant mind hidden in plain sight within a chrysalis
so lets talk about what happens when this all comes together when you tie the three things together
the canadian government in april of 1999 gave back to total control of the inuit an area of land larger than california and texas put together
but if our goal is to inspire innovation and empower more people to build companies of all sizes we need a new way to fund those ideas
and we went to ladakh and we asked this woman  this at minus 40 you have to come out of the roof because theres no place it was all snowed up on both sides  and we asked this woman what was the benefit you had from solar electricity
its not just reality its feeling and reality
theres the galaxy in the middle which is the milky way and around that are the hubble  you know nearby kind of galaxies and theres a sphere that marks the different times
they can let go of one atom and grab another
we simply must converge on the answers we give to the most important questions in human life
we are engineering new anticancer therapeutics to limit toxicity and to reduce drug resistance
and then there were the tricks for managing my workflow
but i see something completely different
and that is wonderful when its about something as goofy as tonsil stones but its a little sad when a video can have an effect like that when its about something as common as periods
this is also a pattern
burke county is one of the poorest districts in the fifthpoorest state in the country and about 100 percent of donnas students live at or below the poverty line
now i think most of us would agree that theres something a little gross about pee
think of cancer bird flu swine flu sars

 live long and prosper
and some tragically dont
this ones my favorite
i bet taylor swift one of the most wellknown and richest singers in the world didnt need more money or fame when she came forward with her groping case for one dollar
we set out to build a model that will cut down almost entirely the cost of higher education
so how we used it was in a room where we had a camera looking into the space and we had one monitor one on each wall
and their policy prescription is to make government more accountable focus on the capital markets invest dont give anything away
the label enemy allowed him to dehumanize us
im part of a team of scientists who has been working to find a cure for alzheimers for over a decade
and whether in the shape of informal concrete slums or broken social housing or trampled old towns or forests of skyscrapers the contemporary urban archetypes that have emerged all across the middle east have been one cause of the alienation and fragmentation of our communities
only 11 people survived that wreck of the 500
my husband brian was also homeless as a kid
but a very important but i love christmas carols
right i mean the turks would love to have only 10000 syrian refugees
so over here you can see how the computer understands the environment and because you cannot see the vibration we actually put red leds on the driver so that you can see whats happening
intention is very important in sound in listening
but you know what
hopefully itll make everyone richer hopefully itll make the game bigger and hopefully itll give cricket commentators more time in the business
first of all i thought well we need a sales team and we clearly arent the ateam here so lets  i did all this training
were all ok
you know the number system we use 10 digits
but you need very very large volumes of water in order to do this
 but besides being a black woman i am different from most of you in some other ways
what
and if so how deep do they take that water
chris anderson thank you so much thats incredible
in kenya 1984 is known as the year of the cup or the goro goro
look invade subdue them take their resources
its no surprise that the twist can be traced back to the 19th century brought to america from the congo during slavery
i gave her reassurance but shortly after 
instead we trained a single network to do all of detection for us
so no csr  corporate social responsibility  isnt the answer but tsi  total societal impact is
separate from the flow separate from you
a couple of different reasons come to mind
there was no leader
and they harvest rain in many ways
by 2020 china is on track to generate germanys entire electricity consumption from just wind and solar power alone
and we will have to understand those as nature and in a way they are
expansive space instead of the isolated bathtub
i remember just being dumbstruck
and in the end then it really comes down to a choice do we want to live in a monochromatic world of monotony or do we want to embrace a polychromatic world of diversity
 and heres the thing
its called a desire path
we can never go back to a place and find it exactly where we left it
have breakfast with my wife and children
so china is very much in the drivers seat determining our global environmental future
and in two hours after their backs were broke they were changed
you see the happy face on mars there
its as if when you bought a book they threw in the printing press for free its like you had a phone that could turn into a radio if you pressed the right buttons
no one is acting as if we were in a crisis
if you look at the hexagon for instance its like an amoeba which is constantly changing its own profile
nigerias telecoms market is the secondfastest growing in the world after china we are getting investments of about a billion dollars a year in telecoms and nobody knows except a few smart people
so it took me from places like chile  the atacama desert in chile  to siberia to underground mines in the japanese alps in northern america all the way to antarctica and even to the south pole
and the food banks are growing
we have secularized badly i would argue
so we damaged about 50 of the magnets
i school striked for the climate
others think about malthusian nightmares
and as an adult refinding these communities has reintroduced me to a community of learners and has encouraged me to continue to be a learner even in my adulthood so that i no longer feel like learning is something reserved for the young
and in fact thats what were going to do right now
now youll be familiar of hacking and leaks that happened in 2016
third content
narrator and so he walked and as he walked he saw things
i dont actually know if were going to be drilling hundreds or thousands of microscopic holes in our heads in 30 years
sm so whats happening here
do it
heres a number that our citizens want to know
