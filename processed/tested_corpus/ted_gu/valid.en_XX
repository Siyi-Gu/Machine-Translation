and those linguists please pardon the grammar because ive not looked at it in the last 10 years
now our voices and body language convey a rich signal
and finally you see the flamboyant cuttlefish in camouflage and it can shift instantly to this bright warning display
when i come back to my desk i can just pinch that information back to my desktop so i can use my fullsize computer
i had to eat right exercise meditate pet dogs because that lowers the blood pressure

i learned that a patient of mine who spoke english without accent was illiterate when he asked me to please sign a social security disability form for him right away
however we are often not aware of these noiseinduced sleep disturbances because we are unconscious while were sleeping

and the little girl says duhduhhoy
and one of the early innovations which still continues is to create ownership in the community to the problem and then engage with them as a partner and here is one such event

the semiconductor industry is very well aware of this and is working on all sorts of creative solutions such as going beyond transistors to quantum computing or even working with transistors in alternative architectures such as neural networks to make more robust and efficient circuits
so lets think how should we measure ourselves
it really doesnt because we have this incredible capacity for togetherness and belonging and by invoking that capacity we can recover those amazing components of our humanity our altruism and cooperation
